            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right worshipfull, <hi>Thomas Couentrey Esquire; of Hill,</hi> and <hi>Croome Debitat</hi> in the County of Worcester; Grace, Mercy, and Peace <hi>from God our gracious and</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, and from our blessed Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</head>
            <p>AS about the space of sixe and twentie yeares since (Right Worshipfull and right deare in the Lorde) I dedicated to your worthy Father (that iust &amp; vpright Iudge (as a testimony of my thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for his manifolde fauours, and for some other respects which I then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) certaine fruitful instructions (as the first fruits of my study and paines-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ministry of the Gospel) which hee wel esteemed and accounted of: So now, for the reasons heereafter expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, haue I presumed to present to your selfe, (though a little, yet) a liuely image
<pb facs="tcp:150910:3"/> of my progresse and growth in the mayne duties of that calling, which no lesse then your godly Father, I am wel assured, you do affect. But yet, from a priuate &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler respect and consideration of your selfe, the principall motiue (as I freely confesse) for the divulging of these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, did not spring at the first, but euen as the Lord God (according to his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence and mighty power, for the good of his children) dooth oftentimes fetch light out of darkenesse, good out of euil, honour, and glory, out of that which in it selfe is loathsome and dishonorable; euen so, from the verie corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some of the hearers, traducing &amp; reproaching, wresting and peruerting them, hath beene deriued the especiall cause of their publication. Whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as a broken voyce sounding in the Ayre, woorthy of no regarde, they had clearely fleeted and vanished away. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the particuler cauils and obiections of such detractors, in an Apology, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to some of the principal Knightes and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:3"/> Gentlemen, and to all others truely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in the East part of our Countie, both Ministers and people, I haue alreadie discouered and confuted at large. Which Apologie, howsoeuer (by some others wel affected, and by my selfe at the first) it was thought fit to be published in as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general a maner as the Sermons themselues; yet vpon later cogitations, I resolued otherwise. For when I haue done my best endeuour for the clearing of mine innocency, touching both Doctrine and life, in the Consciences and experience of such, who dwelling in our Coasts, might be induced by the secrer whisperings and backbytings of the contrary-minded, to iudge amisse, and so to speake euill of the way of saluation; it is enough for mee, though the whole world besides remayne ignoraunt of my condition, and that for euer.</p>
            <p>As the Lord God decreed from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, that there should bee a difference betweene man and man; and that out of one lumpe or masse there shoulde spring
<pb facs="tcp:150910:4"/> two seedes: The elect contained vnder the seede of the Woman, and the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or maglignant Church comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the name of the Serpents seed. So if it may please you to take a serious view and consideration of these ensuing Sermons, you shall clearely discerne, that in teaching and discouering the seuerall notes and markes of this difference, as they are distinguished in the word of God (a Doctrin most vnsauoury and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the Naturall and vnregenerate man, and that the people vnto whom they were preached, might be directed &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the good and right way that leadeth vnto life, and haue their steppes turned from by-wayes and crooked pathes which tende vnto death, consisteth the maine scope and drift of them al; &amp; that there is not so much as one sentence ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it selfe to the reproach or disgrace of any other: but onely of such, who by continuance in euill dooing doo disgrace themselues. According to my measure, which your worship knowoth well enough
<pb facs="tcp:150910:4"/> to be but weake and smal, you shall finde our Lord Iesus Christ in euerie Sermon discouered and pointed out (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so learnedly, eloquently, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically as many others of greater gifts &amp; graces vse to do, yet) so truly, sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and faithfully, I trust, to bee the way, the truth, and the life, that you may haue cause to conclude &amp; to rest resolued, that howsoeuer through the malice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, in the slaunderous tongues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightful endeuours and attemptes of his instruments, the course of my ministery be much interrupted, and verie often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into mine owne bosome agayne, without any good effect in some that hear it, yet doo I vnfaignedly desire the good and saluation of euery one, without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and respect of personnes, and that I apply my selfe for the furtherance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the vttermost of my power.</p>
            <p>But letting these things passe, &amp; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trouble your worshippe, nor to grieue myself any further in discoursing of them, I wil now briefely, through your
<pb facs="tcp:150910:5"/> patience, shewe the Reasons that mooued mee to the Dedication of these my poore Labours, vnto your selfe, which are in number foure.</p>
            <p>First, because I haue founde by long and sure experience, that as you haue suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded your good Father in all the rest of his Vertues and good Qualities; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in vnfaigned Loue and kindnesse to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes mee and mine: Nay, if (vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out note of Flatterie) I may bee bolde to speake, what I haue alwayes found to bee true, the Loue and Fauour which I did enioy in your Fathers dayes, sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no ebbe by his decease, but beecame rather freshly renewed, and verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably flowing with encrease; yea, and (wherein it resembleth the Loue of our Heauenly Father, and much swarueth from the ordinarie Loue of most mortall Men:) it deminisheth not, but dayly groweth more and more with the time. For the ordinarie feeling and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof, what shall I render? Nay, what can I render in any competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
<pb facs="tcp:150910:5"/> Siluer and Golde haue I none, and although I had, yet (God bee praised for it) you neyther neede it, nor expect it (I am sure) at my hands. Well, such as I haue, I heere make tender of. Accept therefore (I beseech you) these fewe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, as our Sauiour Christ did the poore Widdowes Myte; How meane soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it either bee indeede, or may seeme to bee, (beeing compared with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Workes of Learned men) yet is it a great part of the best of such Riches as I possesse: And if it were much better then it is, yet should I as willingly bestowe it vpon you and yours.</p>
            <p>A second Reason is, because that the whole summe and substaunce of two or three of the first of these Sermons heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue sounded in your Worships eares: at what time they found such kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, that although they now come accompanyed with diuers others, yet do I fully perswade my selfe, their welcome therefore will bee no whit the lesse, but
<pb facs="tcp:150910:6"/> rather so much the better; yea, and so as henceforth they shal haue a resting place, not in your house alone, but euen in some part of your very heart, and that for euer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that by this meanes occasion and opportunity may bee offered to adde some little helpe for the furtherance of the peoples saluation in that my Natiue Countrey. From which though I bee seperated in person and habitation, yet not in affection and good will: and the good whereof, in the best things that are, I cannot but vnfaignedly wish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. Which wish and desire of mine, by the commending of this to your Worships patronage and protection, wil bee great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furthered and holpen forward, I know, to a good effect. And last of all, which yet is not the least of all, that vnder your Name and Title, I might expresse some thankefulnesse to the right Christian and vertuous Gentlewoman your wife, and to her Godly and Religious Parents, who now loue mee, not for your sake alone (as
<pb facs="tcp:150910:6"/> I clearely discerne) but for the truth, yea whose Loue and Fauour, whose ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and chearefulnesse (euer since I knew them) by all good meanes, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and by others, to do me good, hath beene, and is so exceeding great, that as I freely confesse, I haue not onely admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, but beene in some sort astonished at it, considering howe free it is alwayes from all desert. But to conclude, if I for my part, see verie good and sufficient cause to reioyce and praise God, as I doo indeede, for your daily growth in fauour both with God and men, for the Riches of Gods mercie and bountifulnesse bestowed in plentiful measure vppon both your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and minde in heauenly and in humain Wisedome and Knowledge, and in manie other fit and necessary guifts and graces; for your Health, Peace, and Prosperitie; for Gods Blessinges and Fauour in your louing and faithfull yoake-fellow, being a chearefull and faithfull helper, as I am wel assured, aswel in matters of Religion, as of this life; and for that godly Stocke
<pb facs="tcp:150910:7"/> and generation from which shee is discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (the fellowship and society whereof, to your very great comfort you do inioy.) As also, for diuers other particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects which I might remember, &amp; that aswel in your little Oliue braunches, as otherwise; and if there bee good and sufficient cause for mee, to pray vnto God to blesse and sanctifie these, and euerie of these, to your ioy and consolation; yea to multiply his mercies in them, and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of them, as your dayes and years: How much more cause you your selfe then haue to reioyce and praise God, for such special loue; and how much more zealously and feruently it behooueth you to pray vnto him, to sanctifie them for you, and your selfe for them; that so in your selfe, in them, and euery of them, the Name of God may be glorified, and your own soule and Conscience strengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them, in the vndoubted hope and assurance of eternal life. I neede not vrge it, as being out of doubt, that with godly Wisedome and Consideration, you
<pb facs="tcp:150910:7"/> do daily remember, and take it to heart. And thus crauing pardon for this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I now take my leaue, and commend your selfe, and al yours, to the Grace and Fauour of God, in Iesus Christ.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He whole Doctrine and circumstances of this 11 Chapter (generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) consist of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall and principall parts. In the first whereof, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle prooueth by many Arguments and authorities that there ought not to bee an vtter desperation of the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:9"/> Iewes, as if they were all generally reiected and forsaken. And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, hee directeth his speech vnto vs Gentiles, that we should not too proudly esteeme of our selues, &amp; despise them. In the first, his purpose and meaning is, to comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corage the Iewes: and in the second, to perswade the Gentiles to modesty and humblenesse of minde. <hi>This is the generall scope.</hi> As touching a more particuler consideration, the Apostle in the latter part of the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hauing preuented two sundry ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of the Aduersaries, which might seeme to haue beene gathered in defence of the Iewes: Now in the beginning of this Chapter (both for the more effectuall clearing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from al malice towards the same people, and for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Doctrine) hee applyeth himselfe to the preuenting of a third Obiection, as though it should yet further be said vnto him by some one
<pb facs="tcp:150910:9"/> of the Iewes, It must needes follow vpon the Doctrine you haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, that God is mutable, and hath now vtterly cast off the Iewes from the Couenant of his grace and mercy, whereas they haue alwaies hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beene his chosen and peculiar people. To which Obiection, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle answereth by a very vehement deniall in the first Verse, saying; <hi>God forbid.</hi> As if he saide, although I haue spoken of the reiecting and casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Iewes, yet I neuerthoght, much lesse saide, that they all general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are reiected and forsaken. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) that any such cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shoulde enter into my heart, or be once vttered with my mouth, for it were a most wicked &amp; damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion to be so perswaded. This is the sence &amp; purpose of this Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of the Apostles aunswere thereunto. The which answere, hee prooueth and amplifyeth in the next wordes, by three most excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:10"/> The first reason hee draweth from his owne example, in the latter part of the first verse. <hi>For I also</hi> (saith he) <hi>am an Israelite of the seede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, of the Tribe of Beniamin.</hi> His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument lyeth thus: If God haue reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all his people, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the pertaking of his grace, then shoulde I bee reiected and cast off, <hi>(For I am an Israelite as they are.) But sure I am</hi> (saith S. Paule) <hi>that God hath not reiected nor forsaken mee:</hi> therefore all Iewes generally are not cast off. The second reason of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, he deriueth in the second Verse, from the fore-knowledge of GOD. <hi>God</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath not cast away his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which hee knew before.</hi> By the fore-knowledge of God in this place, not vnderstanding a generall knowledge, (for so should it comprehende as wel the wicked as the godly) but by fore-knowledge, he heere vnderstandeth a knowledge, ioyned with an election and acceptation of some by speciall
<pb facs="tcp:150910:10"/> fauour, whom he had ordained to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life; according as in this sence is the word so taken, <hi>Verse</hi> 1, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10, 1. and in diuers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As if he had said, God will neuer vtterly forsake those whom hee hath eternally elected. God hath eternally elected some of the Iewes; therefore all the Iewes generally are not forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The thirde reason, which the Apostle produceth, for the proofe and confirmation of his former deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is contained in this Text which I haue read vnto you. And it is drawn and deriued (as you see) from the example of that time wherein <hi>Elias</hi> liued: As if he should say, Euen as in the daies of <hi>Elias</hi> the Lord God reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not all the people of <hi>Israel</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and without exception, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst an innumerable company of prophane &amp; wicked Idolaters, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued yet, and safely kept to him-selfe a certaine number, yea and not a fewe, but manie thousands; which men ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:150910:11"/> the Goddes of the Gentiles, nor were defiled with their abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: euen so of his infinite bountie and goodnesse hath he at this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vndoubtedly preserued some of the Iewes from infidelity, and whom in due time hee will exalt to eternall life: Howsoeuer the greatest multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, thorough the stubbornnesse of their owne hearts, and Tyrannous cruelty against the Son of God, and his faithfull seruants, doo most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably remaine in the state of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Nowe, for the Doctrines which may arise from hence for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> and instruction. The first point most necessarily concerneth all the faithfull Ministers of Iesus Christ, as namely; That to the ende the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and exhortations which they teach and deliuer vnto the people of God, in the publick Ministry &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospel, may cheerefully and without suspition bee heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:11"/> embraced, and obeyed, they therefore bee euermore Religiously careful to approue and confirme that which they teach, &amp; that wherunto they exhort, by the expresse testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and authorities of the Scripture. This (as you see) is heere necessarily gathered from this example of the Apostle S. <hi>Paule,</hi> who knowing well that the Iewes would be ready to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell against his former Reasons, as though hee shoulde arrogantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the promise of saluation was fulfilled in himselfe, and in a few others like vnto him: he therefore in this 3. place, hath recourse to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture, the which hee knew without manifest wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could not be contradicted. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing thereby, that as in the daies of <hi>Elias,</hi> the Lorde preserued verie many frō Idolatry, which <hi>Elias</hi> knew not; euen so at this time, did many of them belong vnto Goddes election, although they could not be discerned
<pb facs="tcp:150910:12"/> in the world. Heerin for further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, we haue not onely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> in manie other places, together with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of all the rest of the Apostles, as we may see in their seueral Epistles and writinges: but euen the example also of our lord Iesus Christ himself, hauing relation for the confirmation of his Doctrine (as we may see in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of his Gospell) somtimes to <hi>Moses,</hi> sometimes to <hi>Dauid,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to one place of the Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and somtimes to another. And now if the holy Apostles of Christ, who could not possibly erre, nor bee deceiued in any point of Doctrine, which they should teach and deliuer vnto the people of God (as writing by the inspiration of Gods spirit, and speaking as they were moued by the Holy-Ghost.) If they thought it an necessary point of Christian Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, both in regard of the discharge of their own duties, and for the good
<pb facs="tcp:150910:12"/> and saluation of Gods people, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and confirm their Doctrine by the authority of the Scripture. Nay, if our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, the author of truth, and truth it selfe, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himselfe heere-unto: Much more then ought all the Ministers to doo the same at this day, as being of themselues subiect vnto errour, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> nothing so sure of any heauenly assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but that they may easily both deceiue and be deceiued. Other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> wherefore all Doctrine shoulde be prooued by the Scripture, are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that alone it is, which all men (vnder paine of condemnation) are bound to beleeue, and whereunto all other writings, testimonies, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities from whomsoeuer they pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceede, and by whomsoeuer they are vttered, ought wholly to yeelde and giue place. Many oftentimes shew great reading in the testimonies of Fathers and Poets, but assure your selues (my Brethren) the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:150910:13"/> and written word of God is the onely Fountaine and Treasure-house from whence al truth of faith &amp; holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to be drawn and deriued, and the onely right Touchstone and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Directory, whereby all truth of Doctrine is to bee tryed and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> And therefore notably. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>If any man speake, let him speake as the words of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> And Isaiah 8. <hi>To the law, and to the testimony, if they speak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, it is because there is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> no light in them.</hi> A third reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such is the Authority of the Scripture, and so hath the Lord san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the same for our vse, that what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soeuer is approoued and confirmed, although it be but by one Testimony of the same, yet it excellently agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and hath a mutuall relation to al the rest, and no lesse reuerendly and religiously ought it to be beleeued &amp; embraced, then if the Lord in an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice were plainly heard to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; pronounce the same from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:13"/> For surely if the Lorde should at this day speake vnto vs, and to our outward eares, as hee spake in times past vnto the holy Patriarks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet would he speake no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then is contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For God is no Chaungeling.<note place="margin">Ia. 1.17.</note> That which was his will when (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the inspiration of his spirit) the Scriptures were written: the same is his will now, and shal be for euer For these reasons most notably doth our Lorde Iesus Christ match him-selfe with the holye Patriarkes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which were before saying.<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note>
               <hi>Io.</hi> 3 <hi>We speake that we know, and testifye that we haue seene.</hi> Now he alone in the ministery of the Gospell, may rightly bee saide to speake and testifye that which he doth know, and hath seene, who confirmeth that which hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by the euidence of Gods worde. This did our Lord Iesus Christ, this did the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and this must all the faithfull Ministers of Iesus
<pb facs="tcp:150910:14"/> Christ do at this day, and from time to time, as being otherwise guilty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of murthering &amp; destroying the people that hear and rely vpon them, in causing them to builde their Fayth and hope vpon erors and lies to their fearefull condemnation. It beeing no better vndoubtedly then verie errors and lyes, whatsoeuer swarueth from, or is in any measure repugnant or contrary to the word of God, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the saluation of all such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue or resolue vpon it. And nowe as heerby the whole summe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all Popish Doctrine is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently approued not to be of God, as being so farre from hauing the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and authority of the holye Scripture to warrant and confirme the same, as that it is flatly repugnant thereunto, as wee shall see God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in that which followeth: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>
               </label> euen so it teacheth vs not only to esteem and account such alone, for the true and faithfull Ministers of Iesus Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:14"/> who are Religiously carefull to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and confirme that which they teach, and whereunto they exhort by the expresse Testimonies of Gods word: but also that in the fear of God we heare and receiue such Doctrines and exhortations from time to time, not as mans word, but as it is indeed the true and holy word of God,<note place="margin">1 Thes, 2, 13 Iam. 1, 21.</note> with feare and trembling, and with ioy and chearefulnesse, as the word that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to saue our soules.

               <hi>Take heede to thy foote when thou enterest into the house of God, and bee more neare to heare, then to offer the sacrifice of fooles: for they know not that they do euill.</hi> And surely this is a notable exhortation, according wherunto if men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be religiously carefull to look to themselues when they come to the hearing of Gods worde, farre more comfortable effects of sounde knowledge, faith, repentaunce, and

Such well grounded Christians were the faithfull <hi>Romanes</hi> vnto whom the Apostle wrote this Epistle, as wee may see not onely in the Inscription, but in diuers other places. And amongest the

            <p>The Reasons wherefore all men <label type="milestone">

The knowledge and vse of the Scripture therefore necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertaineth to the instruction of all the Saints of God. It was written, as the Apostle saith, <hi>For our learning,</hi> whether we be learned or vnlearned, men,<note place="margin">Gal 3, 28.</note> or women, olde or young, <hi>For there is no respect of persons with GOD,</hi> but as the Apostle saith. 1 Tim. 2.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 4</note>
               <hi>He would haue all men to bee saued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people together</hi> (saith the Lord by Moses, Deut 31.<note place="margin">Deut. 31, 12 13.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:150910:17"/> truth, that it is the Lords good will and commandement, that not onely men, but, that men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, should be taught and instructed in his Statutes and iudgements. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> thought it meet also, that the people generally should com to the knowledge of the scripture; &amp; therefore <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. he pronounceth him blessed <hi>whose delight is in the law of the Lord,</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> Now the euident trueth of this point, first, notably tendeth to the confutation of the Papists, whereas by their Doctrine and practise they maintaine, that ignorance is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of deuotion, that inuincible ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is not sinne, and so no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of it selfe to saluation, if men be Christened. For which cause, like the Pharises (whom Christ reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for it <hi>Luke</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Verse 52.</note>) <hi>They take away the Key of Knowledge from the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and wil neither enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God themselues, nor suffer others to enter.</hi> Obstinately affirming, that the knowledge and vnderstanding of the Scriptures, appertaine onely to
<pb facs="tcp:150910:20"/> great Learned men, and not to the common multitude of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: which is asmuch in effect, as if they should say in plaine termes, that the blessednesse of the heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome appertaineth only to great ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and not to the multitude of men and women. For if the kingdom of heauen belong vnto them, then (without exception) all those means withall, which the Lord hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for the building of them vp to that heauenly glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Doctrine notably <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> meeteth with such (as many such there are) who will be readie to say (when they are either exhorted to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for knowledge, or reproued for their ignorance) although I haue not so much knowledge and vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture, as you &amp; others, yet I carry as good a mind, I haue as good intents, zeale, hope, affections, and desires, nothing at all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that whatsoeuer minde, intent,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:21"/> zeale, hope, affection, or desire, is not grounded vpon Gods worde, it is an vnsound minde, an ill intent, a false zeale, a deceitfull hope, a vaine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a corrupt desire, in no sort profitable to those that haue them, but directly tending to the dishonour of God, and prouoking of his wrath. The Israelites had zeale, yea euen the zeale of God (as the Apostle calleth it) Rom. 10. but being not according to knowledge,<note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> it profited them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Vzza</hi> had a good mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in staying the Arke when he saw it shaken.<note place="margin">Verse 9, 10.</note> 1 Chron. 13. but dooing it without the warrant of Gods word, he was fearefully punished with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine death. S. Paule before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion had a good intent in persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church of Christ,<note place="margin">Acts 9, 12, &amp;c.</note> and shall we say that hee did well? Thus wee may see that God will accept no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at our handes, let it carry neuer so fair shewes of Deuotion and good intents, vnlesse it be performed with
<pb facs="tcp:150910:21"/> sound knowledge and vnderstanding according to his word.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this directly tendeth to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> the reproofe of all such (as many such there are) who although they haue heard the word of God many daies &amp; yeares together, and enioy liberty and opportunity to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therin, do yet remain but as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children that are to be fedde with Milke, and not able to digest strong meate. If such be asked any question concerning their worldly affairs, they can easily giue an answere, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render a sound reason of that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch they say. But if they be examined of their estate before God, and how the case standeth with them touching knowledge of heauenly things, faith, repentance, peace of conscience, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods loue, &amp; such like, they are found mute, &amp; know not what to say; yea &amp; which is most of al lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to consider, nothing at all asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (are the greater part) to consider
<pb facs="tcp:150910:22"/> their ignorance in this behalfe. This olde Popish poyson hath so infected mens hearts, as if ignoraunce were better then knowledge. And that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which great necessitie of praier, hath caused the holy ghost to vtter notable exhortations therunto, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. that we should continue in praier,<note place="margin">Verse 12.

               <hi>&amp; watch therunto with all perseuerance and supplication for al Saints.</hi> For this cause is it recorded to the notable comendation of <hi>Anna</hi> the daughter of <hi>Phanuel, that she went not out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but serued God with fasting &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, night &amp; day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 2, 36, 37.</note> Heerunto belongeth the example of <hi>Hannah</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel.</hi> 1 Sa. 1, 12. As also the woman of <hi>Canaan. Mat.</hi> 15. sheweth vs a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of vnwearied constancie and continuance in prayer, she neuer ceasing from the same, vntil she foūd the Lord graciously inclined to grant her desire. And surely a man would thinke that the consideration of our manifolde wants and necessities,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:26"/> should moue vs to a feruent constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and continuance in prayer. For who is he so rich and wealthy, but he hath still neede of the Lords blessing and protection? whose estate so sure and vnmoueable, but it may quickely bee ouerturned and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And who (againe) so holy &amp; perfect, but he hath continuall neede of the encrease of grace? All which, can no otherwise be had, but by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prayer and calling vpon GOD. Now heereunto for our better enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to this duty may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced also the notable effectes which haue ensued vpon the faithfull Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints and seruants of God calling vpon him in the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and troble. As in the first place, what a comfortable effect did there follow vpon this prayer of <hi>Elias?</hi> the Lord graciously deliuering him and the rest of his faithfull, and turning the rage and fury of their cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, to their owne feareful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:26"/> The like comfortable successe had the Prayers of <hi>Dauid,</hi> hee beeing alwayes preserued from the wicked attempts of <hi>Saul:</hi> and the Lord brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the treachery of his vnnaturall Sonne and wicked Counsellors to their owne destruction. The like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had the Lorde also to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Hezekiah, Ieremy, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. The notable effect that ensued also vpon the Prayer of our Lorde Iesus Christ is not to be passed ouer. <hi>In the dayes of his flesh</hi> (saith the Apostle, Heb. 5.) <hi>did he offer vp Prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications with strong crying and teares vnto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note>
               <hi>that was able to saue him from death, and was also heard in that which he feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle in these wordes, not onely declaring, that our Lorde Iesus Christ in the time of his humiliation and according to his humane nature, did pray to his heauenly Father; but that he was most graciously hearde, and comfortably assured of a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<pb facs="tcp:150910:27"/> victory ouer all the enimies of our saluation, according as in short time afterwarde it came to passe in very deede. To these might bee added the comfortable experiences which the Apostles,<note place="margin">Acts 4.

               <pb facs="tcp:150910:28"/> He did not despaire, but was assured, that as the Lorde had promised, so would he not fail to giue him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable deliueraunce from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: according whereunto, ought no extreamities to discourage vs, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hearty praying vnto God, or from reposing an vndoubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of being graciously heard,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5, 14, 15.</note> in whatsoeuer we aske according to his will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the consideration of the notable zeale that was in this holy Prophet wee are taught, that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>4</label> with such a feruent zeale and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nng affection ought all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be inflamed towards the glory and honour of God, as on the one side to apply vnto themselues, &amp; for the comfort and reioycing of their owne hearts, whatsoeuer tendeth to the aduancement thereof, euen as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> themselues were notably honoured and benefited thereby: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side to be no lesse greeued with
<pb facs="tcp:150910:28"/> whatsoeuer tendeth to the reproach and dishonour of his blessed name: then if it were directly intended and applyed against themselues. Such a burning zeale (I say) was in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and excellent Prophet, as euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, not onely in causing all the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> to bee slaine for their Idolatry and blasphemy against the Lord (whereof you heard before) but in that he feared not also to shew himselfe vnto <hi>Ahab,</hi> and that in the heate of all his rage and madnesse, &amp; in plaine and expresse tearmes, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and reprooue his irreligious,<note place="margin">1 King. 18, 18.</note> lewd, and vngodly life. Such a zeale and tender affection towardes the Lords glory, was in the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> he being no lesse touched to the heart with sorrow and griefe, for the blasphemies, for the scornes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which were vttered by the wicked against the Lord, and against the sincerity of his worde and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then if himselfe in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:150910:29"/> had endured them all. As <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.3. Psal. 69, 9.</note>

Such a zeale also towards the Lord, had <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:150910:48"/> the Lorde God hath euer-more his Church vpon the earth; yea, althogh the whole world do seeme neuer so much to bee vtterly ouer-whelmed with vngodlinesse and Idolatry: euen so withall, that wee be so farre from perswading our selues, that it is of necessity, that the Church of Christ should alwayes visibly appeare, with the outward marks and tokens of the same, or with glittering shewes, and vaine pompe, according to the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish conceits, and vaine brags of the Papistes; as cleane contrary-wise to know and vnderstand, that it is much more necessary and conuenient, that it should sometimes be inuisible, and that the faithfull members thereof should be rather afflicted then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, according as of this we shal see more fully in the next point. <hi>Lorde</hi> (saith <hi>Elias) they haue killed thy prophets &amp;c.</hi> The second general, arising from <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> this complaint of the Prophet, and from the consideration of the time
<pb facs="tcp:150910:49"/> wherein he liued, is this. That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God doth fauour and loue his Church, yet doth he often suffer the same to be greeuously afflicted; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as in regard of her manifolde persecutions, thus complayneth the Church,<note place="margin">Verse 1, 3.</note> Psalme 129. <hi>They haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflicted mee from my youth (may Israel now say) they haue oftentimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me from my youth. The Plowers plowed vppon my backe, and made long furrowes.</hi> This (I say) is most cleare and manifest in this History of <hi>Elias</hi> his time. The rage and fury of the wicked beeing so exceeding great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Saints and Seruantes of God, as that they were constrayned to hide themselues in caues &amp; holes, and to the outward view, seemed to be vtterly destroyed from the face of the earth. This may further bee amplified not onely by other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Old and New Testament, but also by the example of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church of Christ, and from
<pb facs="tcp:150910:49"/> thence vnto this present, that there hath beene no one age of the worlde, frō the beginning, but by the church and people of God, preaching, and professing obedience to the will and commandements of the Lorde, haue either generally or in the particular parts and members, been greeuously afflicted and persecuted by wicked &amp; vngodly men, raised vp by Sathan to that end; as <hi>Abel</hi> by <hi>Caine, Isaac</hi> by <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, Iacob</hi> by <hi>Esau,</hi> the whol Church of God by the Egyptians, by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, the Philistims, <hi>Dauid</hi> by <hi>Saule, Micah, Ieremy,</hi> &amp; the rest by the false Prophets of their time, our lord Christ &amp; his Apostles, by the Scribes and Pharisees, the Church of Christ in the beginning, by the heathnish ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, <hi>Nero, Traian, Domitian, Dioclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> after <hi>Constantine</hi> by the Arian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, &amp; in these later dayes, by the Popes, and their instruments. Nay, wher is there almost any faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, or honest christian in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
<pb facs="tcp:150910:50"/> congregation, that maketh Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to discharge his duty in the fear of God, and refuseth to run with the multitude to the wayes of sinne: but the Diuell will be sure to raise vp one wicked instrument or other, to afflict and persecute him at least-wise with the tongue, as <hi>Ismael</hi> did <hi>Isaac,</hi> if they bee restrained from a more violent course. Now as touching the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons wherefore GOD suffereth his Church and chosen people to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes thus greeuously afflicted &amp; persecuted. First we must know, that howsoeuer sin bee the generall cause of all afflictions, yet the Lorde in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting his Children, hath alwayes a further regard then the punishing of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> their sinne. As that his glory in their patient enduring, and in the manner of their deliuerance, might bee effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually magnified and extolled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we see this manifestly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.<note place="margin">Verse 2, 3.</note>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. by our Lord Iesus christ, in the example of him that was borne

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> is, that by afflictions he might proue and exercise their faith and patience, as this is manifest in the example of <hi>Iob.</hi> And as to this effect speaketh the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4, 12. 1 Pet. 1, 7.</note> 1. Epist. 4. and before in the first Chap. <hi>That the trial</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of your faith, being much more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then Gold that perisheth (though it be tried with fire) might bee founde vnto your praise and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi> A third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> is, that by this means they might be drawne nearer vnto God, &amp; more
<pb facs="tcp:150910:51"/> obedient and conformeable vnto his blessed will. For euen as Iron, if it be not occupied will wax rusty; and as the Ayre, if the Clouds be not driuen away with the winde, wil be corrupt and contagious: euen so is it with the children of God, they are more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to euery good thing, much more secure and sencelesse in sinne, much lesse apt to call vppon God, to trust in him, to giue him thanks, and to submit themselues vnto his wil, in the time of ease, peace, and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then in the time of trouble, afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or distresse, according as beside many other which might bee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, this is manifest in the example &amp; confession of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as Ps. 119.<note place="margin">Vers. 67, 71</note>

<pb facs="tcp:150910:51"/> yet they are notwithstanding verie profitable for them, and bring them great commodity. They are dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by them one way, but they are augmented another way: Although their mortall bodies be therby weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; their worldly wealth wasted, their liberty abridged, and euen their very liues oftentimes taken from thē: yet get they plentiful encrease of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heauenly riches, which are not transitory, nor subiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knoledge of God, &amp; of his loue, faith, zeal of Gods glorie, repentance, patience, peace of conscience, the seal and assurance of a far better life; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as heere-unto most notable tend the words of the apostle. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Verses 16, 17, 18.</note>
               <hi>Therfore we faint not, but thogh our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man perish, yet the inward mā is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued daily. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, causeth vnto vs a far more excellent &amp; eternall waight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. While we looke not on the things which are seene, but on the things which are not

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>5</label> kingdome of heauen. And lastly, that it is an vnchangeable ordinance and decree of God, that the godly should haue all their troubles and sorrow in this life, and the wicked on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all their ioy, ease, pleasure, and delight. That the godly sustaine all their anguish and trouble in this life, it is euident, not onely in the Parable of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> presently ascending (after the death of his body) into <hi>Abraham</hi> his bosome,<note place="margin">Verse 22. Verse 13.</note> Luke 16. but also Reuel. 14. <hi>Blessed are the dead, which hereafter
<pb facs="tcp:150910:52"/> die in the Lord. Euen so saith the Spirite, for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> And chap. 21. it is saide, <hi>that God shal wipe away all teares from their eies, and there shal be no more death, neither sorrowe, neither crying, neither shal there bee any more paine, for the first things are passed.</hi> And now, as thus standeth the case with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, euen so clean contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with the wicked and vngodlye, whensoeuer they endure any trouble or sorrowe, it tendeth not to their good (as the troubles of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do) but it is a beginning and an entrance into greater misery, &amp; farre more fearefull iudgements, out of which they shall neuer be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer themselues. Although they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy health, peace, prosperity, and be aduanced to the honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, possesse all things in this worlde which their health can desire, yet heerein haue they no seale of Gods speciall loue, all these things
<pb facs="tcp:150910:53"/> tending to no other ends, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and fat them vp against the day of slaughter. <hi>Their destruction</hi> (as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith) <hi>shall come sodainly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both.</hi> Their glory and honor, their delightes and prosperity, are not only of very smal continuance, but euen as nothing in comparison of their ruin and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which shall be wonderfull fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; continue for euer. According as of this difference speaketh the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle S. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1 Ep. 4.<note place="margin">Verse 17, 18.</note>
               <hi>The time is come</hi> (saith he) <hi>that iudgement must begin at the house of God: If it first beginne at vs, what shal the end of them be, which obey not the gospel of God? And if the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous scarcely bee saued, where shal the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and the sinner appeare.</hi> Heereunto appertaineth also, that notable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Lord, which he vttred as he went towards the place of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,<note place="margin">Verse 31.</note> Lu. 23. <hi>If they do these things</hi> (saith he) <hi>to a greene tree, what shal bee done to a dry?</hi> If the deare Saints and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:53"/> seruants of God, and are as green and ftuitfull trees, who bring forth preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pleasant fruits of holines and righteous. If they by Gods ordinance must in this world be so vexed, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and tormented: where then (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> demandeth) shall the wicked and vngodly ones appeare? what shal becom of them, being so vtterly void of all vertue and goodnesse? Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods iudgements vppon the wicked in this life, we haue in <hi>Kaine, Pharao, Iudas,</hi> and in many other, but howsoeuer they escape (as most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they do in this world) yet shal they not faile to be double and treble recompenced in the world to come: the lesse they heere endure, the more bitter shalbe their pain, and the more grieuous their punishment in hel, &amp; condemnation with the diuel and his angels, out of which there shal be no redemption. Much might be spoken to amplify this further, but by that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deliuered, wee may see clearely
<pb facs="tcp:150910:54"/> enough, that howsoeuer the Godly haue heere all their sorrow, and the wicked in this life all their ioy and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; yet the same ioy and felicity of theirs, is nothing else (in truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) but extreame misery. They liue in pleasure on the earth (as S. Iames speaketh) and in wantonnesse, and nourish their hearts, as in a day of slaughter. For vnto the slaughter must they come at the length, aswell as the Beasts that are fatted vppe. O <hi>Lord</hi> (saith Ieremy,<note place="margin">Ier. 12, 1, 2, 3.</note> chapt. 12) <hi>if I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with thee, thou art Righteous: yet let me talke with thee of thy iudgements, wherefore doth the way of the wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper?

<pb facs="tcp:150910:54"/> of Iudgement betwixt the godly and the vngodly, the proude and all they that do wickedly,<note place="margin">Mal. 4, 1, 2.</note> being burnt as stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so as there shall remain ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roote nor branch in that day, <hi>but vnto al them that feare the Lord, shal the Sun of righteousnesse arise, and safetie preserue them.</hi> Heereunto appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that also of the Prophet Dauid.

               <hi>I haue seene the wicked strong, and spreading himselfe as a greene Bay-tree, yet he passed, and lo he was gone, &amp; I sought him, but he could not bee found.</hi> Also Psal. 73.<note place="margin">Psal. 73, 3, 4 5, 6, 7.8, 9.14, 18, 19, 20.</note>
               <hi>I fretted at the foolish, when I saw the prosperitie of the wicked: for there are no bands in their death, but they are lusty and strong, they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with other men: therefore pride is a chaine vnto them, and cruelty couereth them as a garment, their eies stand out for fatnes, they haue more then their hart can wish, &amp;c.</hi> whereas he for his part was on the contrary, daily punnished and chastened euery morning: But a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

First seeing it is the ordinance of god that his dearest children should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and endure tribulation in this life, be like vnto Christ in humiliation and suffrings, before they can partake of his glory, that therefore in the fear of God, whensoeuer we are any way afflicted, or in distresse, in pouertie, sicknesse, or howsoeuer else; we bee so farre from fainting or being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, as contrarily conceyue hope, and be of good comfort, assuring our selues, that if we truely feare GOD, they are so many arguments of Gods speciall loue and fauour towardes vs. And that seeing (howsoeuer sinne be
<pb facs="tcp:150910:55"/> the generall cause of all afflictions yet) the Lorde God in the afflictions of his children, regardeth nothing so much the punnishment of their sins, as his own glory and their good, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an end also of al their miseries in this life, and so as after this life, there remayneth nothing for them but glory, honor, and peace; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Rom. 3, 4, 5</note>
               <hi>We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in tribulations, knowing that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation bringeth foorth patience; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence experience; experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed, because the Loue of God is shedde abroad in our harts by the Holy-Ghost which is giuen vnto vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second Vse is, that we be so far <label type="milestone">

<pb facs="tcp:150910:58"/> This malice and hatred (I say) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and will neuer haue an end, so long as there is a Deuill, and the Saints and seruants of God, doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vpon the earth.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> wherefore the wicked beare such deadly hatred and malice towardes Gods faithfull seruaunts, is, because such as feare God truly, cānot frame and conforme them-selues to their corrupt humours and dispositions to say as they say, and to do as they doe, according as this reason doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle S. <hi>Peter</hi> render. 1 Epist. 4.<note place="margin">1 Pet 4, 4.</note>
               <hi>It seemeth to them strange, that yee run not with them to the same excesse of ryot, therefore speake they euil of you.</hi> For as light and darknesse, Christ and <hi>Belial</hi> cānot possibly agree in one, no more, is it possibly that prophane and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men should affect, or like of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their hearts, but onely of such as in affection and disposition are like to themselues. And a third reason is, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> because (what shew soeuer they will
<pb facs="tcp:150910:59"/> sometimes make to the contrarie for carnal respects) yet in their harts they vtterly dislike, and cannot abyde the sincere Doctrine of Christs Gospel, which the Saints and seruants of god do preach and professe, as this dooth our Lord Iesus Christ confirme. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Iohn 8, 37.</note>
               <hi>Ye seeke to kil mee</hi> (sayth he) <hi>because my word hath no place in you.</hi> The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of religion is too precise in the account of earthly minded men, and because it tendeth to abridge them of their carnal liberty and licentiousnes, they cannot away eyther with it, or with any of those, who sincerely ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preach it, or make profession of it. Thus haue you seene the Reasons wherefore the wicked and vngodlye, are thus maliciously bent against the children and Seruants of GOD; yea and it is further also to bee obserued in this History and Complaint, that such and so insatiable is the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of such wicked ones, where they beare the sway, that they are so farre
<pb facs="tcp:150910:59"/> from repenting themselues of the former mischeefes and murthers which they haue committed, as that they most barbarously go forward in the same, without remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, neuer restraining their rage, nor moderating their fury, so long as they can finde any of Gods seruantes vppon the earth. <hi>Iezebel</hi> the wicked wife of vngodly <hi>Ahab,</hi> had made such a hauocke of Gods true Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that shee perswaded her selfe, that there was none other of them left, but the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> (yea, and of this minde also, as wee see heere was <hi>Elias</hi> himselfe) and yet shee was so farre, eyther from repenting her selfe, or beeing satisfied with that she had already doone, as that by all possible meanes, she endeuoured her selfe to bring him also to destruction. Heerein we haue many other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as in <hi>Kain,</hi> who after he had once cōceiued a wicked purpose in his hart to murther his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and that
<pb facs="tcp:150910:60"/> for no other cause (as S. Iohn shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.<note place="margin">Verse 12,</note> 1 Epist. 3.) but because his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers workes were good, &amp; his owne euill) he would by no meanes cease or giue ouer, till he had effected it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. In <hi>Pharoa</hi> towards the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the little Infants of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and of <hi>Herod</hi> in his time. Of this disposition also was <hi>Saule,</hi> who by no meanes, nor by any duty of seruice, could possibly bee perswaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <hi>Dauid</hi> into fauour againe, after he had once taken displeasure against him, but continually endeuored him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bring him to Destruction; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Dauid</hi> for his part neuer did him hurt, but the fault was euermore in himselfe: and beeing kindled with displeasure against <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the High-priest, for <hi>Dauids</hi> cause, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse nor reasonable answere, coulde possibly appease or pacify him, vntill fourscore and fiue Priests of the Lord were slaine, and the City of <hi>Nab,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, with all the men, women and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:60"/> children that were in it. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. An other like example whereof we haue in <hi>Manasseth,</hi> of whom it is recorded,<note place="margin">Verse 16</note> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. <hi>That he shed innocent bloude exceeding much, til hee replenished Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem from corner to corner.</hi> And for the like cruelty is Ierusalem also.<note place="margin">Verses 2, 3.</note> Ezech. 22. called a <hi>bloudy City, a City that shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth bloud in the mids of it.</hi> And for this cause also, are such wicked ones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in diuers other places of the Scriptures, to ramping and roaring Lyons, greedy of their prey, such as regard not what tyranny and cruelty they exercise, and shewe what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wast and desolation they make &amp; commit, nor what pittiful mourning and lamentation they cause and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, so as their corrupt and diuellish deuises may be accomplished. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as besides all other examples, this is most apparant in the enemies of the Church, I meane the Papistes at this day. A bloody generation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly; yea surely, as bloodie as
<pb facs="tcp:150910:61"/> any other that can possibly be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, as their horrible massacres and murthering of Gods Saintes in this Land, as also in <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> &amp; the Lowe-Countries; wherein since the years 1520. they haue been the death of one million of christians, &amp; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their late Powder treason, they haue made it manifest vnto all the world. We heereby seeing clearely what is to be looked for at their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, if they might beare the sway, and if the time were come that they haue so long longed and looked for. But <hi>Praised be the Lord, who hath not yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> vs ouer as a prey to their teeth.</hi> Now for the Vses. First we see heere, that the wicked in afflicting &amp; persecuting the children of God, and in bearing such malicious harts against them, do euidently discouer themselues to bee the children &amp; seruants of the diuell, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> our Lord Iesus directing his speech vnto the Scribes and pharisies who went about to kill him, <hi>Yee are</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150910:61"/> (sayth he) <hi>of your father the Diuell, and the lusts of your father ye wil do: he hath bin a murtherer from the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> The childe followeth the steps of his father, and the seruant is obedient &amp; conformable to the wil and comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement of his Mayster. Now the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked being the children and seruaunts of the deuil, what maruell is it, thogh they bee such deadly enemies to the children &amp; seruants of God? It must not be thought strange also, althogh some of them bee Whore-mongers, some drunkards, some vaine swearers and blasphemers, some murtherers, some contentious, malicious, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyous men; they be heerin but as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural children, imitating the steps of their father, and as obedient seruants but fulfilling the wil and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their mayster. A second vse arising from the former Doctrine is this, that seeing the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye in afflicting and persecuting the Saints and Seruantes of God,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:62"/> are euidently discouered to bee the children and seruants of the Diuell: that therefore in the feare of God we take diligent heed, and as wee tender the glory of God, and our owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that neither in affection, nor in life and conuersation, we bee like such wicked &amp; vngodly ones whom the Lorde hath forsaken: but as it is the property of such to hate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute such especially as preach vnto them, and professe among them the word of God; so let vs on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry settle our selues to loue, and like such aboue all others; yea, to aproue our selues to be the children of God, we must loue not onely such as loue vs, but euen our verie enemies, as our Lord Iesus Christ teacheth vs. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. and according to the exhortation of the Apostle Paule.<note place="margin">Verse 44.</note> Rom. 12. <hi>Blesse them which persecute vs.</hi> Not desiring an eye for an eye, nor a tooth for a tooth, as the Pharisies taught their Disciples, but we must be framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:150910:62"/> to the example of our Lord Lorde Iesus Christ, who prayed for his enemies, and did good vnto those that hated and persecuted him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as to this purpose dooth the Apostle Peter propound vnto vs his example. 1 Epist. 2. saying,<note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> that <hi>when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe; and when he suffered he threatned not.</hi> And in verse 21. before he saith, that christ in suffering hath left vs an ensample, that we should follow his steps. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner goeth he forward to exhort. Chap. 3.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 19.</note>
               <hi>Not rendering euil for euil, nor rebuke for rebuke, but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise blesse, knowing that ye are thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called, that ye should bee heire of the blessing.</hi> But now forasmuch as this is a hard matter for flesh and bloud to yeelde vnto, as daily experience prooueth; therefore must all Gods Children alwayes heerewithall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member these two thinges. The first is, that the more wee are hated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, and persecuted of wicked men,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:63"/> the more are we blessed of God; and who will not be well content, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure some hard measure for a time at the handes of prophane and vngodly men, that thereby hee may haue the loue and fauor of God the more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sealed vnto him for euer? And now that this effect followeth to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by meanes of the reproaches and other iniuries of the wicked: our lord Iesus Ghrist <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5, 11, 12.</note> doth plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, <hi>Blessed are yee when men reuile you, and persecute you, and say al manner of euil against you for my sake falsly. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen, for so persecuted they the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which were before you.</hi> And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing that to this end we are to remember, is, rhat thus behauing our selues, wee shal therein haue a most comfortable testimony that wee are the children of our heauenly Father, who maketh the sun to shine, &amp; the rain to fal aswel on the bad as on the good. And therewithal the true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb facs="tcp:150910:63"/> and followers of our lord Iesus Christ, who when his Disciples wold haue had him to haue commaunded fire from heauen, to haue destroyed a City of <hi>Samaria</hi> as hee passed by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Citizens refused to giue him entertainment; sharply rebuked them as we see <hi>Luke</hi> 9. saying, <hi>Ye know not of what spirit ye are, for the sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them.</hi> Who also healed the ear of <hi>Malchus,</hi> yea althogh he was one of them that came to apprehend and to bring him to death. These 2. points if we could remember, especialy when wee are tempted &amp; prouoked by the malice of wicked men, they would be forcible enough to represse &amp; keepe vnder al affections &amp; atempts of rage &amp; reuenge. Considering &amp; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with our selus, that it must needs bee a maruailous vnthankfulnes, not to endeuor our selues to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our heauenly father, &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our sauior, who so louingly

<pb facs="tcp:150910:64"/> thou art greatly deceiued; for there are euen many thousands in Israell of good and godly men, whom I (sayth the Lord) haue so safely kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued from the generall Apostacy of the rest, as that they neuer shewed so much as an outward countenance of well liking their Idolatry.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>4</label> hence ariseth this general point, that forasmuch as the Lorde God hath an absolute dominion ouer al creatures both visible and inuisible, ruleth and directeth all things both in heauen &amp; in earth, according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his will, against which will of his, no man nor any other creature is able to resist, nor to accomplish any thing, either more or lesse: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> altogether in vaine: For why? there is no wisedom, there is no power nor counsel against God; though people fret and fume, though princes rage, though al consult and lay their heads together, how they may oppresse and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:65"/> tyranize ouer such as feare the Lord, yet <hi>Hee that sitteth in heauen will laugh them to scorn, the Lord wil haue them in derision,</hi> confounde all their deuises; yea and oftentimes so mightily tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth ouer his enemies, &amp; so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth and prouideth for the good of his seruants, that notwithstanding al their malice and peruersenesse, their very enemies are constrained to doo them good, &amp; to be a notable means for the encrease of their happynesse before the Lord. This is manifest in this history. <hi>Iezebel</hi> that cruell perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, made full account that she had vtterly destroyed all the Prophets &amp; Seruants of God, <hi>Elias</hi> onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whose blood (as you hearde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his complaint) shee in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner greedily thirsted and sought after: but notwithstanding all her rage and fury, the Lorde preserued Elias, and many thousandes more, who neuer suffered them-selues to bee defiled with the abhominations of that time.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:66"/>
               <hi>Pharao</hi> King of Egypt, made full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to haue destroyed vtterly the Church of God from the face of the earth, when he made that cruel Edict against the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that all the male children should be drowned, but the Lorde encreased them so much the more mightily, and caused euen the Daughter of that cruell tyrant, to be a norisher of Moses, the deliuerer of Gods people, when by reason of that wicked commandement he was cast forth, as <hi>Ex.</hi> 2. <hi>Balaac</hi> K. of <hi>Moab</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued himselfe vpon a wonderful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish and subtle deuise against the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; was come to the very practise of it, <hi>Balaam</hi> also that false prophet (for the loue of his hire) was as ready as he, to haue pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a fearefull curse against the same people, yea although most wickedly and desperately against his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: but what effect had it?

<pb facs="tcp:150910:71"/> being considered in it selfe, it is very large &amp; ample, comprehending infinite multitudes of Gods elect and faithfull children, who are sealed and sanctifyed to eternall life. In the daies of Elias, when in outward apearance there was nothing to be seen but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable wickednesse and idolatry, all generally from the highest to the lowest, hauing corrupted their waies rebelling against God, &amp; licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walowing in the lusts of their own hearts: yet notwithstanding, at that very time (as this text sheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the Lord God had a notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of faithfull Worshippers, and although a small handfull, in respect of the vngodly, yet surely not a few, but a very great number, being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by themselues. And nowe if so bee that in so fearefull a falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; yea, and when the Lord had yet no other peculiar people vppon the earth, but the Iewes alone: If there were then (I say) so many faithfull
<pb facs="tcp:150910:71"/> members of the Church of God, and sincere Worshippers of his name: What then is to bee thought of the church of Christ, vnto whom (as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Verse. 8</note>) <hi>The Nations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

There is no doubt (I say) but the church of Christ (in this time of the gospel) is much more large &amp; ample, and the number of Gods elect a farre greater number, by great oddes. For this cause is the church called Carho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that is to say vniuersal, not <hi>Iewish,</hi> not <hi>Roman,</hi> not <hi>English,</hi> not consisting of any one nation or people, but cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted (as it were) into one body, out of al nations, ages, callings, &amp; degrees

<pb facs="tcp:150910:73"/> of themselues, but of the smalnesse of their number, in comparison of the vnbeleeuers, of the vngodly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. But oh (will some peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bee ready to aske) is the number of Gods elect still the lesser number? Surely will they say, howsoeuer it hath bin in times past, and howsoeuer among the Papists, the heathen and vnbeleeuers, who liue in Blindnesse and ignoraunce, the number of the wicked may be the greatest: yet wher the Gospell is preached it cannot bee so; in such places the children of God are without all question the greatest number. For do not all (saith they) at this day, come to the church, heare Gods word, receiue the Sacraments, &amp;c. and wil you exclude any of those from being the true mēbers of Christ and of his church? To this I answer, that the church of Christ in this time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he gospel, is vndoubtedly a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Church, yea surely much more glorious for number &amp; multitude of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:73"/> sincere professors, then heeretofore, the Lorde hauing some faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, &amp; true harted christians euery where, who first seek his kingdom &amp; the righteousnes thereof, who labor nothing so much for the meate that perisheth, as for that which endureth to eternall life, who are Religiously careful to make the word of God the Lanthorn for their feet, and the light for their paths, &amp; prefer the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods glory, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, before al respect of themselues; the number of whom, I most hartily beseech the Lord to multiply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease more and more. But yet, that still remaineth true which I sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in comparison of prophane and wicked men, their number is but small, and a little handfull. All such as come to the church, hear the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods word, receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, professe themselues prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, &amp; no papists, &amp;c. Al these, do I
<pb facs="tcp:150910:74"/> acknowledge members of the visible Church. But euen as in a fielde there is not onely good Corne, but also weeds; and as in a threshing Floore, there is not onely pure wheat, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so chaffe; and as in a Net that is cast into the Sea, there commeth vp not onely good things, but also bad: euen so, in the visible Church, there is a mixt and confused multitude of both, good and bad: not onely such, who with vpright hearts and good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doo serue and obey the Lorde Christ, but such also as are euen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to euery good worke, and whose end is, to be cast out from the presence of God, and to be burned as chaffe, in the fearefull furnace of his indignation and wrath. For a man therefore to haue a comfortable assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he is a member of Christ, and an heyre of Gods kingdome, hee must not content himselfe, nor think it enough for him, to be a member of the visible Church. But if he feele the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:74"/> spirit of GOD preuailing in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the corrupt lustes and motions of the flesh, and so as notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manifolde temptations of the world, the flesh, and the diuel, he first seeke Gods kingdome and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse thereof, labour more for the meate that endureth to eternall life, then for that which perisheth, if hee bee Religiously carefull to make the worde of God the Lanthorne for his feete, and the light for his paths, and so as withall he grow and encrease in Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, and in Obedience according thereunto, as in yeares and dayes, if his latter workes be better then his former, &amp; he bring forth fruite in his age, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in Psal. 92. If hee then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himselfe to bee most happy, when hee is made an Instrument to aduance Gods glorie, and doe highly regard it, aboue himselfe. If his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and godlinesse bee not onely in outward shew and profession, but in
<pb facs="tcp:150910:75"/> all goodnesse, righteousnesse, &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. These and such as these are, are most vndoubted Testimonies of a blessed estate, and that such a one is out of all question, a true member of Christ and of his Church, a man sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and sanctified to eternall life. Wheras on the contrary, whose life and conuersation is repugnant and contrary heereunto, either destitute of sounde knowledge and Faith, or contenting himself, with a bare shew and profession of it, being zealous in the mean season, to glorify God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the duties of the first, nor of the second Table: All such are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnworthy of the name and Title of true Christians, the Doctrine of the Gospell cannot be said to haue taken roote in their hearts, the fruites that proceed from them cannot be called the fruites thereof, planted in their hearts by the Holy-Ghost, but the fruites and effects of their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vnregenerate hearts, engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:150910:75"/> in them by the spirit of Sathan, as a sure seale of their iust condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. According as of this difference, speaketh the Scripture in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as <hi>Math.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Verse 21.</note>

The same being not tyed to any number or multitude, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of those who truely beleeue in Christ, and yeelde a sound obedience vnto his Gospell, how small or great soeuer their number be. Great was the number of them in the time of Elias, who professed them-selues to be the true Church of God, &amp; which in euery respect were as dilligent and deuout, in the obseruation of their outward ceremonies, as the papistes are, or can bee at this day, in their blind superstition, traditions or deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but yet howe far they were from being in truth and indeede, what they outwardly pretended: this complaint of the same Prophet, beeing himselfe persecuted by them, dooth plainly proue. The like is also to be seene, by cōparing the great multitude of the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:79"/> aduersaries of Christ, in the time that he liued (which were then accounted the Church of God) with the small number of those, who truly beleeued in his name, and yet not the greatest number (for all their bosting and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shewes) were indeede the true church, but euen that little and small remnant: wherby it is euident (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the papists brag to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) that to haue the greatest number on their side, is no argumēt to proue their synagog to bee the true church of christ, but rather the contrary, that being true (as it is most true) which you haue heard before.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> it is manifest by that which you haue heard, that the flock of Christ is but little, &amp; that the least number go in at the strait gate that ledeth to life, that therfore we take diligent heed, as we tender the glory of God, and our own saluation, that we frame neither our religion nor conuersation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the disposition of the greatest part,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:80"/> that we think not our Religion to be therefore good, and our conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on warrantable, because the most part do as we do.

And surely (if it be well marked) this is a wonderfull effect and woorke of Gods grace, and heerein dooth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be mighty indeede, when as after this manner, it casteth downe holds, the immaginations also, and euery high thing which is exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the knowledge of GOD, and bringeth into captiuity euery thoght to the obedience of Christ, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle thus speaketh. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.

If we be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the wicked and vngodlye of the world, and so as we runne not with them in the wayes of sinne and prophanesse, if we perceiue our selus to be sanctifyed in all the partes and powers of our soules and bodyes to
<pb facs="tcp:150910:87"/> serue and obey God, with true zeale and feruency of Spirit, according to the rule of his word. If wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued power in any good measure to subdue our lustes, and so forth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those particulers which you heard before: these and such like, are notable Testimonies that the Lorde hath preserued vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued vs, euen for himselfe.

               <hi>Deutro.</hi> 27. how the Lord pronounceth a fearful curse against the same; euen so on the contrary, is the sincere worship and seruice of his name, so deere and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his account, as that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly abide, that any of his faithfull seruants, should in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at all, swarue or degenerat from the same, to shewe any little counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or to giue any consent or wel-liking to any other manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then himselfe hath prescribed &amp; commaunded. It is not enough to loue and feare the Lord with all our soules, and not to consent to Idolatry in our hearts, but wee must abstayne from all appearaunce of euill in this respect, and not so much as with a word of our mouth, or with any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
<pb facs="tcp:150910:90"/> of body, shew any reuerence at all thereunto. The faithfull people of God in the dayes of Elias (as also Elias himselfe) might no doubt, haue liued in peace and prosperity, if onely in outward maner, they would haue serued the Idols of the Gentiles, and but with the gesture of their bodyes haue bowed themselues to <hi>Baal;</hi> but they knowing the Lord to hate al hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and dissimulation, and that not their soules onely, but both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and soules, ought wholy and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be dedicated and consecrated to his seruice, they would not therefore in the least measure that might bee, shewe any token of well liking the same. According whereunto, ought to be the constancy and resolution of all the Saints and seruants of God, at this day, and from time to time, so as although the whole world bee giuen neuer so much to Idolatry and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlynesse, and although the heat of persecution be neuer so great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb facs="tcp:150910:91"/> against the sincere profession and obedience of Christes Gospell: they yet notwithstanding alwayes continue constant in the wayes and will of God, without framing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in any degree at all, according to the manners and Obseruations of the wicked. <hi>Not fearing them which kil the bodie, but are not able to kil the soule, but fearing him, which is able to destroy both soule and body in hell,</hi> as our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe thus exhorteth. <hi>Math.</hi> 10, 28.</p>
            <p>This is further confirmed in <hi>Com.</hi> 2. where the Lorde forbiddeth not onely such Images as are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present himselfe (forasmuch as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inuisible spirit, and an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible essence, not like to man, Woman, or any other Creature, in any shape, quality, or Naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, cannot therefore possibly bee represented by any Image or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude whatsoeuer: according as wee see in the Prophets, how hee
<pb facs="tcp:150910:91"/> openly setteth his voyce agaynst all counterfet shapes of him, to the end wee may know, how they make themselues guilty euen of forsaking GOD, who couet to haue any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible forme of him, and that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestye of God is defyled, when hee beeing without a bodye, is likened vnto a bodilye matter, beeing inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to a visible Image, beeing a Spirite to a thing without life, and beeing incomprehensible to a lumpe of Wood, Stone, or such like: As Esay 40.<note place="margin">Esay 40, 8.</note>
               <hi>To whome will yee liken GOD, or what similitude will yee set vppe vnto him?</hi> And Chapter 44. hee likewise sayeth, that <hi>All they that make an Image are vanitie, and theyr delectable thinges shall nothing profite, and they are their owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that they see not, nor knowe: Therefore they shall bee confounded.)</hi> As the Lorde (I say) in the second Commaundement, hath forbidden all such like Images as are made to
<pb facs="tcp:150910:92"/> represent himselfe (for seeing heauen and earth, and all things therein, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently represent God, much lesse can vile images made with mens hands, who haue neither life, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, nor any thing at all, like vnto the mighty God:) euen so in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the making of al other Images to any Religious or superstitious vse. If we come where any such images are, we must not bow vnto them, neither for their owne sakes (which is the grosser errour) nor yet in regarde of them whom they are made to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which is also bad enough, yea, and too too badde; according as this particular, wee haue often occasion elsewhere to consider at large. But nowe (before I passe any further) to call to minde some Reasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Idols and Images ought thus to be detested and abhorred. A first <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> Reason is, because it is the will and Commandement of God, that all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, with all corrupt worshipping
<pb facs="tcp:150910:92"/> of the true God, should be vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">Exod. 34, 13, 14.</note>
               <hi>Ye shal ouerthrow their Altars, and breake their Images in peeces, and cut downe their Groues, for thou shalt bow downe to no other God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord, whose name is Ielous, is a iealous God.</hi> To this effect also again, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for this cause (I meane for the taking away and abolishing of Idolatry, and false maner of worshipping the true God) are <hi>Iehu, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iosias,</hi> so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended in the holy scripture. Secondly, they are to be detested and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> abolished in regarde of our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: we professe to worship God in spirit and truth, with which spiritual worship, the hauing and retaining of Idols &amp; Images cannot stand. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> for auoyding of offence, least the ignorant people should bee seduced, and the enemies of the Church take occasion to estrange themselues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of, and to speake reproachfully of the heauenly truth. According as
<pb facs="tcp:150910:93"/> heereof, there is experience in the Iewes, who beholding Images in the Churches of some of such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them-selues to bee Christians, become thereby greatly offended, and much discouraged from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the trueth. And surely, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee founde in any place of the Scripture, that Images did euer good, but contrary-wise, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in verie many places, that they haue done much hurt, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God haue beene most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deceyued, and beguiled by them, as in the bookes of the Iudges, Kings, and Prophets.</p>
            <p>Much might bee spoken, but by this wee may see clearely, that as all sinne in generall, so especially the sinne of Idolatrie, is so loathsome and odious before the presence of the Lordes Maiesty, that howsoeuer hee suffer men licentiously to giue themselues thereunto for a time, yet in the end, continuing without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:93"/> hee will not fayle most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely (according to his Righteous Iudgements) to punnish and take vengeance vpon them for the same: according as <hi>Esay</hi> 42.<note place="margin">Esay 42, 8.</note>
               <hi>I am the Lorde, this is my Name, my Glorie will I not giue to another, neither my praise to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Images.</hi> For inasmuch, as hee hath betroathed himselfe (as it were) to the Company of the Elect and faithfull, as to a Spouse and chaste Virgin, hee cannot abide, that they should bee defiled with the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous woorshipping of Idolles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as for this cause also, dooth hee oftentimes call him-selfe a <hi>Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God,</hi> that will not suffer his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bee violated, nor himselfe to bee robbed, of that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongeth vnto him, to haue it giuen vnto other Creatures. <hi>The Lorde thy God</hi> (sayeth Moses, in <hi>Deutronomy</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Deut. 4, 24.</note>) <hi>is a consuming Fire, and a iealous God.</hi> For as an husband, (the more holy and chast himselfe is)
<pb facs="tcp:150910:94"/> the lesse can he abide, that his Wife should giue and encline her loue and liking to another: euen so, the Lord hauing wedded vs (as it were) to him selfe by his word, testifieth, that hee hath a most feruent burning ielousy, as often as we are defiled with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lusts, &amp; especially when we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre vnto any other, or do intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with any superstition, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and seruice of his name, which ought to bee kept most holy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, insomuch that he wil not fayle, most seuerely to punnish the same. According as besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the perticuler punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted vpon the Gentiles for their Idolatry, whereof speaketh the Apostle. Rom. 1.<note place="margin">Rom. 1, 24, 26, 28.</note> saying, that for this cause, god gaue them vp to <hi>their harts lusts, into vile affections, yea and vnto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not conuenient.</hi> Heereof we haue a notable example and discourse. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 8. where wee read that when the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:94"/> Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> was carried of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the haires of his head into <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> he saw in it, not onely that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll of indignation, whereby the wrath of God was prouoked; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the Temple, hee perceiued that on the walles thereof, were painted beasts, liuing creatures, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of creeping thinges, whereunto the chiefe elders of the people, with much reuerence, offered Incense, so giuing vnto them diuine honor. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the Prophet saw on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, women mourning for <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> who was another Idoll of the Gentiles. And lastly, he beheld in the Sanctuary, men who turning theyr backe to the most holy place, and their faces toward the East, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Sun towards the East. For al which Idolatry and abhominations, the Lorde by his Prophet threatneth in the last verse of that chapt. <hi>That he will execute his wrath, that his eye shall not spare them, neither wil he haue pittie,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:95"/> and though they crie in his eares with a loud voyce, yet will hee not heare them.</hi> But now, as the Lord thus expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbiddeth the worship of Idolles, and Images, euen so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, dooth hee strictly enioyne and commaund the right worship and seruice of the onely true God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Mathew</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Math. 4, 10.</note> out of <hi>Deutronomy</hi> 6. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi> Worshipping and seruing, by this sentence of the Lorde, are mutually linked and knit together, and cannot bee separated the one from the other.</p>
            <p>Whereby it is manifest, that as the Lord God, onely and alone is to bee serued: so is it his good will and pleasure, onely and alone to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. For this cause most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (sayeth our Lorde Iesus Christ) <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Iohn 4, 23.</note>
               <hi>That the true Worshippers, shall worship the Father:</hi> Not this Angell, or that Saint, <hi>but the Father,</hi> vnto
<pb facs="tcp:150910:95"/> whom all Glory, Honour, Woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and Seruice, dooth belong, speaking of Religious Worshippe and Seruice, as our Sauiour dooth in that place. Heereupon also it was, wherefore the Prophet Elias, teaching that GOD cannot abide, to haue any thing at all worshipped besides himselfe, cryeth out. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.<note place="margin">1 Ki. 18, 21</note> vnto those, who thought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, and the Idoll <hi>Baall</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Howe long hault yee</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>betweene two Opinions? If the Lord be God, followe him, but if Baal be he, then goe after him.</hi> As if he should haue sayde; It is not possible for you, to Worshippe God and <hi>Baall</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>No man</hi> (as Christ speaketh, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Math. 6, 24</note>) <hi>can serue two Maysters.</hi> The Lord God will not bee content with a peece, but hee requireth our whole heart, our whole minde and soul to the worship and seruice of his Maiesty, hee leaueth no part thereof, to be bestowed vpon any other. And
<pb facs="tcp:150910:96"/> therefore most excellently. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. doth the Apostle vse this as a Reason, to shewe that Christ is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the Angels, because the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doo worship Christ, but they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine are not worshipped. Nowe, if the angels be not worshipped, whom then shall wee account in heauen or in earth, worthy to be worshipped? Surely no other at all, but onely the true, eternall, and euer-liuing God. According as to this effect, tendeth most notably the voice of the Angel. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Reuel. 14, 7</note>
               <hi>Feare God, and giue glorie to him, and worship him, that made heauen and earth, and the Sea, and the fountains of water.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:150910:96"/> is outwarde and bodily, and may bee performed aswell of the wicked, as of the godly, that is not to be accounted for the true worship of God, but the heart and minde it is, which he especially respecteth and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at, as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">1 Sam 16.7</note>
               <hi>Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the heart.</hi> According as this is manifest in the example of <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Kaine,</hi> and in the Offeringes which they offered vnto God, whereof wee read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Gen. 4, 5.</note> The Sacrifice of <hi>Kain</hi> was reiected, not in regarde of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde matter thereof, but because it proceeded not from a faithfull and vpright heart, as did the Sacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> and which therfore most sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smelled in the Nostrils of God, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Heb. 11, 4.</note> the Apostle discussing this matter, hath these words; <hi>By faith A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel offered vnto God a greater Sacrifice then Kain, by the which he obtained wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that he was righteous.</hi> For this cause (saith <hi>Moses</hi> to the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150910:97"/> Deut. 10.<note place="margin">Deut. 10, 12</note>) <hi>And now Israel, what doth the Lorde thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lorde thy God, to walke in al his wayes, and to loue him, and to serue the Lord thy God with al thy heart, and with al thy soule.</hi> This may yet further be manifested, by the sharpe reproofe which the Lorde maketh, Esay 1. <hi>What haue I to doo with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of your Sacrifices sayeth the Lord? I am ful of the burnt Offerings of Rams,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 1, 11, 13, 14.15, 16, 17.</note>
               <hi>and of the fat of fedde Beasts: and I desire not the bloud of Bullockes, nor of Lambe, nor of Goates. Bring no moe Oblations in vaine, Incense is an Abhomination vnto mee, I cannot suffer your Newe Moones, nor Sabaoths, nor solemn dayes:</hi> and so further at large, as you may see in that place; wherein (at the first) it may seeme straunge, that the Lord should so cry out against these thinges, which were of his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and appoyntment: But the Reason is, because they thought to please God with these outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:97"/> and were vtterly destitute in the meane season of faithfull harts, and vpright affections; without the which, the Lorde neuer promised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fauourable acceptation of these outward thinges, according as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde hee plainely expoundeth his owne meaning, saying; <hi>Wash you, make you cleane, take away the euil of your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes from before mine eyes, cease to do euil, learne to doo well, seeke iudgement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the oppressed, iudge the fatherlesse, defend the widdow, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> also, in chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 6. bringeth in the person of one, and after this manner reasoning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true and right Woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe and seruice of God:<note place="margin">Micah 6.6, 7, 8.</note>
               <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>shal I come before the Lorde, and bowe my selfe before the hie God? Shal I come before him, with Burnt Offeringes, with Calues of a yeare olde? Wil the Lorde bee pleased with thousandes of Rammes, or with ten thousand Riuers of Oyle? Shal I giue
<pb facs="tcp:150910:98"/> my first borne for my transgression, euen the fruit of my bodye, for the sinne of my soule?</hi> Vnto all which demandes, hee maketh this answer, liuely describing the true Sacrifice which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. <hi>Hee hath shewed thee, O man</hi> (saith hee) <hi>what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee? Surely to do iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to loue mercy, and to humble thy selfe to walke with thy God.</hi> Many other testimonies might be produced, but by these it is most manifest, that God was neuer delighted with any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde circumstances in the worship and seruice of his name, but onely so farre forth, as they proceeded from a faithfull and vpright heart. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as this, dooth our Lorde Iesus Christ yet further confirm. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Iohn 4, 24</note> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirite and in truth,</hi> plainly there teaching, that to the end mē may worship God aright, it behooueth them to enter into due consideration of his naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:150910:98"/> and delight. For euery thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth that which is according to his naturall inclination, and lotheth and disliketh whatsoeuer is repugnant &amp; contrary to the same. Now then, if the Lord God consist of a bodily and corporall substance, then doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and will be delighted with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bodily worship; but if he be not bodily, but altogether spirituall, then doth he not expect, neyther can possibly be pleased with external ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, the same beeing so contrary to his Nature. And now that the Lorde God consisteth altogether not of a bodily, but of a spirituall substaunce, and therefore cannot away with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worship, to be satisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: what can be more manifest to put men out of doubt, then that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lorde Iesus Christ, which was set downe before? And it is not to be passed ouer, how hee sayth not in that speech, that it is meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that such as worship God,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:99"/> should worship him, <hi>in spirite and in truth:</hi> but that they <hi>must worship him in spirit and in truth.</hi> And to what end doth hee vrge it so strictly and say, it must be so, if it could possibly agree with his Nature, to bee pleased and delighted with eternal thinges. This cannot possibly be, but it is of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, that they who will be accounted true worshippers, doo worship and serue him in spirit and truth. <label type="milestone">

               </label> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the miserable estate and condition of the Papistes, is euidently discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who together both with their bodies and inward affections, do giue themselues wholly to Idolatry, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falling downe, and creeping e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to very Stockes and Stones; which haue eyes and see not; eares and heare not, &amp;c. But let vs a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle (before we proceede any further) consider some of their maine and speciall Reasons for that which they doo. First (they say) that they doo not worship the Image it selfe, but
<pb facs="tcp:150910:99"/> God whom it representeth. But we learne out of the Prophets, and in the second Commaundement, that it is a most wicked presumption, to erect any signes, by which God either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or ought not to be signifyed; and that hee forbiddeth aswell the false worship of the true God, as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of any part of his true worship vnto any other. And although they were signes, by which God coulde bee truely signifyed, yet lyeth it not in the power or Authority of any Creature, to erect and set them vp, but onely by the will and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lorde. Secondly, (they say) that Images bee Bookes of the Lay and vnlearned people, and therefore profitable, but the Spirite of God teacheth vs otherwise, when hee sayeth,<note place="margin">Hab. 2, 18.</note>
               <hi>Habbacuk</hi> 2. that it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, <hi>To bee a Teacher of lyes.</hi> And Zachary 10.<note place="margin">Zach. 10, 2. Ier. 10, 8.</note>
               <hi>The Idols haue spoken va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> And Ier. 10. <hi>The stock is a doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:150910:100"/> of vanitie:</hi> by all which places it is most cleare, that Images teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to lye of God, and to speake vainly of him; and therefore, (if we will do none of these) we must neyther make Images, nor haue thē. Thirdly they say, it was lawfull for the <hi>Israelites</hi> to haue figures; as the Cherubim, Seraphim, and diuers pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and that therefore it is lawfull for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to haue Images in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But these figures of diuers thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other pictures in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> had the warrant of Gods word, neyther could they easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be abused. And besides this, the purpose of GOD in erecting them, was, that they shold be figures of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thinges, all which haue taken their end in Christ. And thus are the chiefe Reasons which the Papistes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for their idolatrous worship, most clearely discouered, to bee not onely weake, but vaine and foolish.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:100"/> Furthermore, what els is to be said of the whole body of their religion and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all other partes and branches of it? Is there any thing at all therein, but what he that is most wicked may doo and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme aswell as he that is most godly and best affected? Is it not altogether carnall and outwarde, as if they accounted God to be no spirit; but to consist (as mortal men doo) of a bodily and corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? As in this or that fashion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, this or that kinde of gestures, choise of meats, difference of daies, times and places, numbring of Beads, building of Monasteries, fasting in Lent, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Holy-water, going on Pilgrimage, numbring of Prayers, crossing, annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, shauing, Ringing of Bels, going to shrift, and such like outward and bodilye actions; not hauing any motion or work of the Holy-ghost in the inwarde man: they thinking to please God with these corporall Ceremonies, and humaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and neuer thinking of spirit and truth, nor knowing (for the most part) what it meaneth; but letting them alone
<pb facs="tcp:150910:101"/> in their blindnes, vntill it may please God to open their eyes. As this doctrine, and the example of these true woorshippers of God, in the dayes of <hi>Elias,</hi> do tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly also to reprooue the warrantable resolutions of all such, who perswade themselues, that they may lawfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble in matters of religion, especially in the time of persecution, and think that if their hearts consent not vnto it, they nothing at all offend, although with their bodies they bow vnto <hi>Baal,</hi> and do reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in outward appearance to idolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous worship; euen so, it teacheth vs, not onely according to the exhortation of the Apostle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 14. <hi>To flie from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> knowing that no Idolaters shal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heauen; and for this cause keepe our selues, according to the example of these 7000. aswell from all maner of outward appearance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as from consenting thereunto in our hearts, striuing to this ende against all temptations, and against all iniunctions and commandements to the contrary &amp; zealously, crauing the gracious ayde and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:101"/> assistance of Gods blessed spirit: but also seeing the right worship and seruice of God, according to his word, is so deare and precious in his account, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the feare of God, acknowledging him alone, to be the only true God, who onely and alone is to be worshipped; we loue him therefore aboue all, feare him aboue all, pray to him only, acknowledge him alone to bee the onely authour and Fountaine of all good things, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vppon, and repose all our trust and confidence in him alone, and so forth; as is prescribed and commanded in the first Table of the ten Commandements. And heerewithall, seeing the true Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers do worship God in spirit and truth, that therefore we do not only account of the worship &amp; seruice of god, as of a debt and duty strictly required at our handes: but that in the feare of God, we be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more religiously carefull to present our selues before him therein, with vpright hearts, and sincere affections, praying and beseeching the Lord to this end with the Prophet <hi>Dauid.</hi> Psalme 51, 10. <hi>To
<pb facs="tcp:150910:102"/> create in vs new hearts, and to renew right spirits within vs.</hi> In which Praier, we haue need to bee so much feruent and earnest, not onely because Hypocrisie is most lothsome before the face of God, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as wee are all naturally enclined thereunto, desirous to be thought and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed far more holy, religious, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affected then we are indeed; far more ready to find fault with others, then to be reformed our selues in that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, speaking against others for their ignorance &amp; prophanesse, when wee our selues are as ignorant and prophane, as slacke and carelesse in al duties of holines and Religion, as they or any other. How highly therefore it standeth vs vppon, to striue against this Naturall hypocrisie of ours, and not onely to represse and keepe it vnder, but so also, as that it may bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly expelled &amp; rooted out of our harts, and as in all the wayes and actions of this life, so as we may walke vprightly, work righteousnesse, and speake the truth from our hearts, knowing what the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. that such alone shall
<pb facs="tcp:150910:102"/> enter into Gods Tabernacle: so especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in matters of Religion, and when ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Prayer, hearing of Gods worde preached, or in any other part or branch of his worship and seruice, we are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selues before him; euerie one that hath any spirituall discerning, may easily perceiue, and conclude with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. It followeth verse 5. <hi>[Euen so then at this present time, is there a remnant through the election of grace.]</hi> Now in these words (by an argument drawne from the like) doth the Apostle apply the former histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and example of the daies of Elias vnto his present purpose: as if he said, as in the time of Elias, there was a certain number preserued by the Lord, which neuer ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Idols of the Gentiles; euen so, there is no doubt, but that the Lord God acording to his eternal purpose of grace, hath a faithfull remnant of elect Saints at this day, whom hee will exalt to eternall life; howsoeuer the greatest multitude, by reason of their vnbeleefe and hardnes of heart, do miserably remain in the state of condemnation. This is the sence of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:103"/> this application; wherin besides this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary instruction that is fitly offered for al the Ministers of Iesus Christ, that they alwaies be religiously carefull (according to this example of the apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply their doctrines &amp; exhortations to the present occasions and necessities of the church. We learn and obserue for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> point, that the former experience of the Lords goodnes &amp; mercy towards his Church and chosen people, aswell in their preseruation from Idolatry, from the rage and fury of wicked &amp; malicious enemies, as in all other respects and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of his loue, ought so fruitfully and effectually to be remembred of al ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations from time to time, as to enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to hope in God for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of like fauour, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto true patience &amp; constancy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distrusting or despairing in the midst of whatsoeuer troubles, afflictions, and calamities may arise in the world. To this end it is, that the Apostle heer alledgeth this example of <hi>Elias</hi> his time, that the Iewes calling to memory the estate of

And as to this end doth the Apostle heer produce the history and example of Elias his time; euen so, to the very same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, doth the Holyghost make mention of the notable experiences, which <hi>Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Dauid, Daniell,</hi> and many others, had of Gods special fauors, in protecting and deliuering them from many great dangers; as also of the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profite which they reaped, for a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and religious depending vpon God, all the dayes of their life afterward.

<pb facs="tcp:150910:105"/> he felt so great experience of the Lords mercy towards him, that in the 1. Epist. 4. he is bold to exhort the faythfull to reioyce in sufferinges, and to glorifye God therein, without being ashamed. The like effects ensued also vpon such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences as the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> had, as we may see, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. and in many other places. Many other examples might be aledged, but as by these it is manifest, how nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Saints of God profited by the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer experience of Gods loue and fauour in times past; so no lesse ought wee to profite to a couragious resolution, and faithfull expectation at this day, &amp; from time to time, by such experiences as wee haue had. I will not stande vpon many particulars, but if I should go no further, then to the experience of Gods loue, in the abasing of his Sonne, vnto the most excellent worke of our Redemption, it would bee sufficient, as farre surpassing all other experiences whatsoeuer: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as this very Vse, doeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle make for our comfort and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this behalfe, <hi>Romanes</hi> 8, 32. <hi>Who

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> The Apostle after this manner, giuing
<pb facs="tcp:150910:110"/> to vnderstand, not onely that such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to eternall life, are elected through the meere grace and free mercy of God, and that in the action it selfe of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Workes haue wrought nothing at all, whereby God should the sooner bee mooued thereunto: but also, that it is a very foolish and absurd thing once to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, or to be perswaded; that Grace and Workes can be ioyned together, in the question of election, seeing they are so disagreeable in themselues. If a man be elected by grace, that is freely, it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with no reason at all, to thinke or say, that he is elected by Workes, or in consideration of any deserts. For that which is deserued eyther in part, or in whole, cannot be sayde to be giuen free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing there is a consideration of the guift, or at least wise, some cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it should bee giuen. And nowe, that election is of grace, and of grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; besides the plaine and expresse words of this Text, this dooth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle confirme. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. where he deriueth
<pb facs="tcp:150910:111"/> all our holinesse and righteousnesse, and whatsoeuer good thing either is, or can be in vs, from the election of God: <hi>Hee hath chosen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before him in loue.</hi> Also 2. Tim. 1, 9. <hi>Who hath saued vs</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>and called vs, with an holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpose and grace, which was giuen vs through Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, before the world was.</hi> In these words it is plaine, that we are neither called nor saued in regard of workes, much lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected then, either for them, or in regard of them. Most notably also. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 7. doth the Apostle vtterly disanull all the glory that men can chalenge to thēselues in regard of woorkes, saying; <hi>who separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee? And what hast thou, that thou hast not receiued? If thou hast receiued it, why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycest thou as though thou hadest not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it?</hi> In which words, hee speaketh not of one or two graces, but whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to eternall life▪ the apostle there affirmeth the same to be receiued; yea, &amp; that of free grace, as yet more plainely.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:111"/> Eph. 2, 8, 9. <hi>By grace are ye saued thorough faith, and that not of your selues, it is the gift of God, not of workes, least any man shoulde boast himselfe.</hi> Now, if man haue nothing that belongeth to eternall life, but what he hath receyued of grace of free gifte, of fauor and mercy, is it not an odious pride and an horrible vnthankefulnesse for any man to imagine or say, that for his faith or Good-workes, God hath elected and predestinated him to the dignity of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? Much might be alledged, but in one worde it is most certaine, that if the whole Scripture bee searched, there will no one sentence be found, that affirmeth God to haue chosen vs in respect of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, or because he foresaw that we would be faithfull, holy and iust; but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, all the Testimonies that concerne this matter, do euidently affirme, that we are freely chosen of God in Christ Iesus, according to the purpose of his wil. Euen as heerunto belongeth this notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Church, and elect of God. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4, 11. who casting their crowns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that sat vpon the Throne, <hi>Thou
<pb facs="tcp:150910:112"/> art woorthy O Lord</hi> (say they) <hi>to receiue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and honour, and power: for thou hast created all thinges, and for thy wils sake, they are, and haue beene created.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Chapter 5. they falling down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lambe, do sing a new song, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Booke, and to open the Seales thereof, because thou wast killed, and hast redeemed vs to God by thy bloud, out of euery Kindred, &amp;c.</hi> No men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all do we see heere, of any works, or worthinesse in man, but the worke of Creation, Redemption, and the whole sum of glory and blessednesse, is ascribed and attributed onely and altogether to the free grace and mercy of God in Iesus Christ. The grace and mercy of God in Iesus Christ (I say) is the Originall and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of all our happinesse and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. From thence proceedeth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our election, but also our redemption, our calling, our iustification, our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and all our hope of eternall life, and in no measure at all from any worthinesse or deserts of ours, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so farre from deseruing anye part of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:112"/> Gods loue, as that beeing his verie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (by reason of our sinnes) wee are woorthy of nothing but of his fearefull wrath. And therefore notably sayeth the Apostle, <hi>Romanes</hi> 5, 8, 9. <hi>That GOD setteth foorth his Loue towardes vs, seeing that while wee were yet sinners, Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vs. Much more then beeing iustified by his blood, wee shall bee saued from wrath thorough him.</hi> And 1. Iohn 4, 9, 10. <hi>In this appeared the loue of God towards vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God sent his onely begotten Sonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Worlde, that wee may liue thorough him. Heerein is loue, not that wee loued God, but that he loued vs, and sent his Son to be a reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see, how truely the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayeth heere of election, that it is of Grace, and that most truely the same is also to bee verifyed, as touching Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Calling, Iustification, with whatsoeuer else dooth belong, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise, appertaine vnto eternall Life. And nowe, if that they bee of Grace, it is then absurde (as the Apostle heere teacheth) to impute the cause of them
<pb facs="tcp:150910:113"/> in any measure vnto workes: eyther they must bee wholly of grace, or wholly of workes, for seeing they are so contrarie, they cannot possibly be ioyned together in one and the same action. <hi>If it be of grace then is it not of workes, and if it be of workes, then is it not of grace.</hi> And surely, this is such a notable argument of the Apostle, that whosoeuer cannot see the clearnesse of the same, to confesse and extoll on the one side, the grace and mercy of the lord, in election, redemption, calling, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: and on the other side, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue himselfe and all others generally, of all opinion and imagination of meriting or deseruing eyther the one or the other, he giueth vndoubtedly, a very great To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the Lord hath blinded his eyes, and vtterly giuen him ouer to a reprobat sence; yet the Papistes notwithstanding, (thorough the iust iudgement of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them) are nothing at all ashamed to deny and cauel at the light and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the same, affirming that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh heere of such good-workes onely, as are doone of nature, and not of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:113"/> such as are doone of faith; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it is neuerthelesse true, that the Lord God in election, had regard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good-works which the elect shold do afterward; and whereby they should deserue their election; and that such as are iustified, are not iustified through the free grace and mercy of God in christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, apprehended and aplyed by faith, but through faith and workes ioyned &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring together. Wherein, besides their grosse absurdity, in calling workes doone of Nature [Good-works] whereas <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is not of faith, is sin; and without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> as Rom. 14 23 and Heb. 11, 6. It is most cleare &amp; euident that the Apostle speaking of election by grace, by which all are saued, that are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hath relation not onely to works of Nature, but excludeth from the same the merit of al works generally, aswell of the circumcised Iewes, and baptized Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as of the vnbeleeuing Gentiles. And whereas they alledge, that God in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had regard vnto such Good-workes, as should afterward be performed, &amp; that
<pb facs="tcp:150910:114"/> Fayth and Workes, are of necessity to be ioyned together in the matter of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; although these verie wordes of the Apostle, bee of such sufficient force to ouerthrow both the one, &amp; the other (as that euery one that delighteth not in ignoraunce and errour, may plainely perceiue the weakenesse of their asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:) concluding euidently, that Grace, which we apprehend by Fayth in Christ, and Workes, are so contrary, that where Grace is, there all merit of workes, must of necessity bee displaced: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing partly, because this Doctrine of theirs, is wonderfull iniurious to the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the death and passion of our lord Iesus Christ, vtterly making the same of no effect; and partly, because this is the most principall and waightiest point and principle of all Popery, so as take away this, and the whole substance thereof fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the ground, And heerewithall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to the end, that (through the grace of Gods spirit) you might both effectually be confirmed in the truth, and be able to confute the contrary assertions of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:114"/> For these considerations, it shall not bee amisse, to adde that which hath beene spoken, some other authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Scripture, with manifest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons drawne from the same; that it may plainely appeare, howe plentifully the Word of God, teacheth that truth which wee professe, and not in one place alone, but in many places handleth the same. As touching the first; whereas they say, that election is grounded vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of such Good-works as God fore-saw the elect would performe: It is most certaine, that (forasmuch as wee were all corrupt in <hi>Adam</hi>) GOD coulde fore-see nothing in vs, that should moue him to choose vs. So as take away elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what remayneth, but that wee be vtterly lost and accurssed. <hi>Al our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> (as the Prophet Esay speaketh) Esay 64, 6. <hi>is as filthy clowts.</hi> Nowe, if this bee true, that all our Righteousnesse is no better then filthy Clowtes, and yet God (as the Papists would make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) did chuse men in regard therof, thē must it needs follow, that he chose them
<pb facs="tcp:150910:115"/> in regard of that which was filthy &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; but God forbid that any such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation shoulde once take place in anie Christian heart. God hath chosen vs in his eternall purpose for his owne glorie to be manifested in vs, and this hee did in Christ his sonne, in whome alone is our whole perfection. How grosly and falsly they conclude also concerning the other point; where they affirme that faith and workes must bee ioyned together in the question of iustification; we neede go no further then to the expresse Testimonies of the Apostle, Rom. 3, 20, 21, &amp;c. where he sayth not onely that <hi>by the workes of the Law, no flesh shalbe iustified;</hi> and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>the Righteousnesse of God is made manifest without the Law, and is by the faith of Iesus Christ, vnto al, and vpon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> And againe, <hi>that we are iustified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, thorough the redemption that is in Christ Iesus:</hi> but also after al this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this euident conclusion; <hi>We conclude that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the Law.</hi> Againe, according to that in chapt. 4. if <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith onely,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:115"/> were imputed vnto him for righteousnes then through the imputation of Christes righteousnesse, we are iustified by Fayth onely, but the first is true in that place, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham beleeued God, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse;</hi> therefore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond must needs also bee so to. Another like saying to that of this Text, hath the same Apostle in the nexte verse of that chapter, <hi>To him that worketh</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>the wayes is not counted by fauor, but by debt. But to him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly, his Fayth is counted for righteousnesse.</hi> The Apostle in these words plainly shewing, that the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by any workes at all, dooth cleane ouerthrow and destroy the grace of God, and doth make grace and workes as contrary, the one to the other. And if our iustification be partly of works, then by the apostles reason, it is partly of debt, and cannot be counted of fauour, but the reward (as hee teacheth) is rendered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to grace, and not according to debt; therfore we are not iustified before God in any measure, by workes, althogh
<pb facs="tcp:150910:116"/> they proceede neuer so much from faith. And wheras they obiect further, that the Apostle in all these places, excludeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ceremoniall workes of the Lawe from iustification: it is very cleare to the contrary, that the Apostle writing this Epistle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> (who were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and neuer troubled with keeping of the Iewish Ceremonies) had no cause at al, to exhort them frō any confidence of iustification by the same. But to come to some other Reasons, wherefore al works are thus excluded from Grace and Fayth in the questions of election and iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. First we must knowe, that all our workes,<note place="margin">Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> euen the very best, are vnperfect, and therefore cannot deserue any thing, according to that, <hi>Galathians</hi> 5, 17. <hi>The flesh lusteth against the Spirite, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite against the Flesh; and these are contrarie one to the other, so that yee cannot doo the same things that ye would.</hi> Secondly, all the Good-workes which we at any time can do, are al due and indebted vnto god, as Luke 17, 10. <hi>When yee haue done al those thinges which are commaunded; Say</hi> (sayth
<pb facs="tcp:150910:116"/> Christ) <hi>wee are vnprofitable seruantes, we haue doone that which was our duty to doo.</hi> And wee must do our duties, and pay our debts, before wee can deserue any thing. Thirdly, it appeareth plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11, 12, 13. that we are both elected and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, before we do any Good-workes, as it is there proued, by the example of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> as concerning whom, euen before they <hi>Were borne, and when they had neyther doone good, nor euill, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God might remain, according to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not by workes, but by him that calleth. It was sayde vnto her, the Elder shall serue the younger, As it is written, I haue loued Iacob, and haue hated Esau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, if any thing should be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs to iustification, then Christ should not giue vs true and perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and saluation; and thereupon it would follow, that our Sauior should not bee perfect; but hee is most perfect, according to this notable saying of the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 6, 7. <hi>That God to the praise of the glory of his grace hath made vs accepted in his beloued, by whom we haue redemption
<pb facs="tcp:150910:117"/> through his bloud, euen the forgiuenes of sins, according to his rich grace.</hi> Moreouer, in al the Goodworks that we do, <hi>It is God which worketh in vs both the wil and the deed, euen of his good pleasure,</hi> as the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>But euil</hi> (as he teacheth also in another place) <hi>is so present with vs, that the good which we would do, we cannot do.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the motion of Gods grace wee would do it, but through the corruption of our nature we cannot do it; yea, when we do any good at all, we are so far from perfect doing it, as that it may rather bee tearmed a will in vs to doe good, then a right doing indeed. For we ought to loue God with all our heart, with al our soul, and with all our minde, but so long as the flesh lusteth in vs against the spirite, and there is a lawe in our members rebelling against the Law of our mind (which will be so long as wee liue in this world) wee cannot be saide to loue God with all our hart, with all our soule, and with al our mind; so then, in far lesse measure then we ought. Now that which is lesse then it ought to be, is imperfect, as transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:150910:117"/> the rule of Gods Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4, &amp; 12. Wherefore, seeing our works in this life ought to be done in perfect loue toward God &amp; man, and that perfection of loue we haue not in this life, it most clearely followeth, that all our works in this life are faulty, yea although they be wrought by the grace of Christ. Not that the grace of Christ in it selfe hath any blemish or imperfection, God forbid; but because we, in whom it worketh, are corrupt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as water, though it flow from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine most cleare, yet if it run through a filthy and muddy channell, becomes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and muddy as the channel is. Much might be spoken, but this is a sure thing, that we fulfill the Law of God, neither in all, nor in any of our workes, and failing of the perfection thereof, in any or in all: we are by the sentence thereof, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced accursed, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 10. out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 27 <hi>Curssed is euery man, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Booke of the Law to do them.</hi> So then we see, that the workes of Gods children; yea, euen the very best of them, howsoeuer they
<pb facs="tcp:150910:118"/> are termed Good-workes, yet are they not during this life, properly or perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, but imperfectly good, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly holy. They are good by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, and good by acceptation: by comparison, and in respect, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakuk,</hi> chap. 1, 13. calleth a man righteous, not simply, but in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the wicked. And good by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the sight of God, who (dealing as a louing Father with his Children) vouchsafeth to take that in good part, which we do willingly, although we do it weakely, graciously beholding vs in Iesus Christ, and so imputing vnto vs his righteousnesse and obedience, as that we remaine without danger of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in due time are exalted to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory. But now against this trueth, there are diuers Obiections. First, it is probable (say our aduersaries) that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes must be ioyned with grace and fayth, in the questions of election and iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seeing at the latter day, when wee are all to appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ, the triall of euerie mans
<pb facs="tcp:150910:118"/> cause, shal not be made by grace or faith, but by workes, alledging to this purpose diuers places of the scripture, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 29 where our Lord Iesus doth not say, that at the later day, they which beleeue, shal haue eternal life, and they which belieue not, eternall death, but they <hi>That haue done good, shal come forth to the resurrection of life, &amp; they that haue done euil, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of condemnation.</hi> Also that of the apostle, 2 Cor. 5, 10. where he sayth, <hi>That we must al appeare before the iudgment seat of Christ, that euery man may receiue the things that are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or euil.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20, 12. <hi>And I sawe the dead</hi> (saith <hi>Iohn) both great and small stand before God; and the Bookes were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life, &amp; the dead were iudged of those thinges, which are written in the bookes according to their workes.</hi> But of al other places, that seemeth most manifest in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. where the reason of calling of the elect to the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heritance of the heauēly kingdom, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly taken from workes, it being there recorded,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:119"/> that the heauenly iudge (after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the sentence, wherein hee calleth them blessed of his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and giueth them possession of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory) shall proceed, saying, <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meate, I thirsted, and ye gaue me drinke, I was a stranger, and ye lodged me, &amp;c.</hi> But now, howsoeuer by these places it is certaine, that the trial and examination of euery mans cause, shall be made (after this manner) not by Faith, but by works, yet that it is not any thing at all in regard of works, but onely of Faith, that the heritage of eternall life is imparted, it is so cleare in the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alledged, as that we cannot desire any thing more apparant. Whereunto may also be added, this comfortable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 14, 15, 18. <hi>As Moses lift vp the Serpent in the Wildernesse, so must the Sonne of man bee lift vp, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not perish, but haue eternall life.</hi> And again, <hi>He that beleeueth in him shal not bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he that beleeueth not, is condemned already, because he beleeueth not in the name
<pb facs="tcp:150910:119"/> of the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> Also <hi>Iohn</hi> 6, 40, 47. <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that euery man which seeth the sonne, and beleeueth in him, should haue euerlasting life, and I wil raise him vp at the last day.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Verily, verily, I say vnto you, hee that beleeueth mee, hath euerlasting life.</hi> Heereunto belongeth that also of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. <hi>Acts</hi> 13, 38, 39. <hi>Bee it knowne vnto you therefore, men and Brethren</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>that thorough this man</hi> (that is to say tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Christ) <hi>is preached vnto you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sinnes, and from all things, from which ye could not be deliuered by the Law of Moses, by him euery one that beleeueth, is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</hi> By all these (with many other testimonies that might be produced) it is most cleare, that howsoeuer the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudge shal make mention of workes at the latter day, and howsoeuer thereby it may seeme at the first, that workes are as auaileable, or rather more auailable then faith, to the obtaining of saluation, that yet it is farre otherwise, the Lord recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his elect into eternall blessednesse, through his onely mercy, and free grace
<pb facs="tcp:150910:120"/> in Iesus Christ, and so accordingly crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their works, being wroght as fruits of faith in him. The kingdome of heauen (as wee must know) is not a rewarde for seruants, but an inheritance for sons, and which they onely shall enioy, who are adopted of the Lord for his children, and that for no other cause, but for the same adoption, <hi>For the Son of the bond-woman, shal not be heire with the son of the Free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> The Lorde God doth examine our workes in loue, and not in rigor and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity, rewardeth them with infinite glory, not in regard of themselus, but as they proceed from faith in Christ, &amp; are no other but his owne meere gifts. For euen as natural Parents, bestow gifts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their children, as reward of their wel doing, thereby to encorage them to the greater vertue and godlinesse, when as yet the true and proper cause of the gifts is not the obedience of the child, but the meere goodwill and loue of the father; euen so, the Lorde allureth vs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to holinesse of life, and esteemeth vs as righteous and worthy, when as in
<pb facs="tcp:150910:120"/> the meane season, all the righteousnesse and worthinesse that is in vs, proceedeth wholly from his free grace and goodnes. Secondly, they obiect against this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of election and iustification, by <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>2</label> grace and faith, that it is a Doctrine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and openeth a wide gap and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to sinne and licentiousnesse. For who say they, will make any conscience of forsaking sin, when he knoweth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse to be so ready? Who wil bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his affections, and punish himselfe by Fasting, Prayer, and other godly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when he sceth so easie &amp; light a way to heauen, as by grace and faith onely? But first we are heere to know, that this is no new reproach and slaunder Fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the Gospell and heauenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our saluation. For euen after this manner, did the proud and self-liking Pharisees, vpbraide and quarrell with our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, because he preached and offered Gods free grace to Publicanes and Sinners. And Rom. 6, 1. wee may see, howe readie the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Gospell were to cauell
<pb facs="tcp:150910:121"/> with S. <hi>Paule,</hi> as though the same Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine preached by him, had giuen liberty to sin and dissolutenesse. Secondly, that this is a very false and wicked slaunder of the Papists, not bearing any countenance or likelyhood of truth in it. It is heereby manifest, because the same spirit, which is the spirit of faith, and perswadeth our Consciences to beleeue the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and mercy of God towardes vs in Christ Iesus, is also the Spirit of loue, and doth enflame our hearts to loue so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and mercifull a God, as did vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe (when wee were yet his enemies) to deale so graciously and louingly with vs. Nowe then, if by the motion of one and the same spirit, we doo by faith assuredly know Gods goodnesse towards vs, &amp; by the knowledge and true sence thereof, do loue him for the same; Needs must there follow obedience to his Law, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall studye to please him. Faith then of necessity breedeth loue of God, and loue bringeth forth obedience to his will. <hi>For if any man loue me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>he wil keep my word, Iohn</hi> 14, 23. This loue, I say, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="tcp:150910:121"/> Gods children to obedience, and is the root of all their good dooings. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as nothing can keepe good children so much in obedience, as to knowe their Parents loue and good affection towards them; so nothing can more effectually moue true Christians, to the true feare of God, and to the performaunce of that which he requireth, then by the Gospell to learn and to be assured of his vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodnesse towardes them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the same Doctrine, that teacheth vs that by Gods free grace and meer mercie in Iesus Christ, wee are become his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and heires of saluation: the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth teach vs also, that the end and cause of this grace and speciall fauour is, that we should glorify God in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies so much the more, and not be slaues and seruants vnto sin. No man ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someth a captiue, to the end hee should continue to serue his enemy. Christ hath ransomed vs, not with Golde and Siluer, (as <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, 1 Epist. 1.) <hi>but with his owne precious bloud,</hi> to the end wee should be wholy employed in his seruice, and not
<pb facs="tcp:150910:122"/> in the seruice of our lusts and corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. This was the end of his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherefore he tooke vpon him our sins, with the curse &amp; condemnation due vnto them, that we being deliuered from the guiltinesse of sin, from the wrath of God, and torments of hell, might be his peculiar people, sanctifyed to serue him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of our life, euer-more vnfainedly acknowledging (as the truth is) that the best seruice that we can doo, is vtterly of no value, in comparison of the least of his mercies towards vs. Thus you see, how little cause the Papists haue to slander &amp; reproch this doctrine of the Gospel, as if it gaue liberty and encouragement to sin and licentiousnesse. But oh (say they) you talke much indeed of Good-workes, but what vse is there of doing Good-works, if by them we cannot merit the fauor of God and eternall life? For answer wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, we must know, that there are diuers necessary and notable endes of dooing Good-works, though this proud popish opinion of meriting, sinke downe to hel.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:122"/> As first, that by the dooing of them wee <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>3</label> may glorify God. Now God is glorifyed in our workes, when we do such workes as he hath commaunded, not to aduance our owne estimation and credite among men, neither yet with any purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue at Gods hands; but to expresse our obedience to his commaundements and thankfulnesse for his great mercies &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits towards vs, Vnto the which kinde of glorifying God, doth the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 20. <hi>For ye are bought,</hi> saith he, <hi>for a price, therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirite, for they are Gods.</hi> Secondly, we must do Good-workes, to approue our faith, &amp; to make our calling &amp; election sure. For euery tree is known by his fruit, &amp; goodworks are assured ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, signs and testimonies, of a true faith; &amp; therfore <hi>Shew me thy faith,</hi> saieth <hi>Iames</hi> ch. 2, 18. <hi>out of thy works, &amp; I wil shew thee my faith by my works.</hi> Thirdly, we must do good-works for the better winning &amp; alluring of others to faith &amp; obedience, according to that of Iesus Christ. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 16. <hi>Let your light so shine before mē, that they
<pb facs="tcp:150910:123"/> may see your Good-workes, &amp; glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heauen.</hi> And whereunto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth that of the Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi> 1 Pet. 2, 12. <hi>Dearely beloued, I beseech you as strangers and Pilgrims, abstaine from fleshly lustes which sight against the soule, and haue your conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation honest amongst the Gentiles, that they which speake euil of you, as of euil dooers, may by your Good-workes which they shal see, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in the day of the visitation.</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must do Good-workes for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and comforting of such as are any way in neede of our helping hand, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as heereunto tend the plentifull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and exhortations of the Scripture, as Luke 6. <hi>Be ye merciful,</hi> saith our Sauior, <hi>as your heauenly Father is merciful, and giue</hi> sayth he, <hi>and it shalbe giuen vnto you;</hi> and many other, which are so often remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I neede not heere stand vpon thē. By this which hath bin deliuered, you see I trust, now clearly, that althogh we hold and beleeue that wee are neither elected, nor iustifyed in regard of workes, but by grace and faith onely, yet condemne wee not Good-workes (as the Papists slander
<pb facs="tcp:150910:123"/> vs) but earnestly teach and require, a true and lawfull doing of them, according to the will of God; <hi>Knowing</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh. Eph. 2, 10.) <hi>that we are the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of God, created in Christ Iesus vnto good-workes, which God hath ordained that we should walke in them.</hi> Let this then stande <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>4</label> for the last vse and conclusion of all, that howsoeuer we hold it not a matter indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whether we do good-works or no but that we be zealous in the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery good duty, which the lord requireth of our seueral places &amp; callings: yet when there is any question of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we euermore take diligent heede (as we tender Gods glory &amp; our own good) that wee neuer trust to our workes, but knowing &amp; acknowledging the very best of them, to be doubtfull, corrupt, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and vncertaine (and that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God therefore do not depend vpon them, neither haue they any thing at all in themselues, and as they proceede from vs that shuld moue God to make vs bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.) Wee repose and settle all our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and hope of saluation, onely and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb facs="tcp:150910:124"/> in the free grace and meer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, through the righteousnes and obedience of Iesus Christ. The which grace, the Lord vouchsafe vs for his sake, Amen.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150910:124"/> not in Christ Iesus, as they should haue done, but with a vaine trust &amp; confidence of their owne workes. This is the sence of this conclusion.</p>
            <p>Now for the Doctrines; wee are first <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> to obserue in this generall point, that righteousnesse and saluation is onely in Christ Iesus, in him alone to bee found, and not inherent in any man, nor to be had or obtained by any worldly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde meanes. This beeing heere most manifest, in that the Apostle say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heere so expressely, that both the elect, as the not elect, sought after it. Whereby it is made manifest, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the elect, as the not elect, were without it, and had it not in themselues. And this dooth the Apostle most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably confirme. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 2, 3. by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who as hee there sheweth, had all his righteousnesse by imputation. And nowe, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had no Righteousnesse of his owne, who else haue had it, (our Lord Iesus Christes person onely excepted) but <hi>Abraham</hi> had it not, for his righteousnes
<pb facs="tcp:150910:125"/> was only by imputation, he was not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and without sinne indeed; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted righteous; and therefore much lesse all others without exception. All the righteousnesse that is, or can be in man, without imputation or account from God, is properly nothing else but a vaine confidence and perswasion of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that we are woorthy of Gods loue, and deserue his fauour, the which in very deed is so far from rightly deseruing the name of righteousnesse; as that it is no better then presumption and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wickednesse before the face of God. The Apostle in the tenth Chapter, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewing, that such a vaine and arrogant conceit of their owne righteousnesse, was the principall cause of the reiection of the Iewes and of the cutting of them off from the couenant of grace. The Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> before his conuersion, had a great conceit of his owne righteousnesse, but he was no sooner called to the faith of Christ but he esteemed it all to be but losse, and euen as dung, as hee protesteth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 8, 9. and therfore desireth to be found before God,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:125"/> not hauing his own righteousnes which is of the Law, <hi>But that which is thorough the faith of Christ, euen the righteousnesse</hi> (saith he) <hi>which is of God through faith.</hi> It being most sure and certain, that so long as men haue any conceit of their owne righteousnesse, the righteousnes of God in Iesus Christ, neither doth nor can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto them, these being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other (as we shal see further heereafter) as that they cannot possibly stand together. And therefore most notably, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143, 2. <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy Seruant: for in thy sight shal none that liueth be iustified.</hi> And Dan. 9, 7, 18. <hi>We do not present our supplications before thee, for our owne righteousnesse, but for thy great tender mercies.</hi> And a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>O Lord righteousnesse belongeth vnto thee, and vnto vs open shame, as appeareth this day, &amp;c.</hi> True it is, that after regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the faithfull become holy &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the sight of God, hauing recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Spirit of sanctification, for the renewing &amp; reformation of their minds, and for the glorifying of God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:150910:126"/> of their own saluation, in the fruits of the spirit, in all goodnesse, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and truth: but this righteousnes cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by the grace of God, cannot bee tearmed their own; and therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 7. <hi>What hast thou, that thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued? If thou hast receiued it, why reioycest thou as thogh thou hadst not receiued it?</hi> The Lord God alone is properly righteous, and holy, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 145, 17. <hi>The Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his wayes, and holy in al his works,</hi> and all other, are righteous onely so farre foorth, as they are made righteous by him. Now hee maketh men righteous (as I noted before) by freely receyuing them into fauour, and by imputing of Christes Righteousnesse to the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their sinnes, and to their iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, planting also in their hearts, a true and liuely Faith, for the perticular apprehending and applying of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And they that are thus made righteous by God, haue no conceit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny righteousnesse of their owne, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging themselues most wretched and miserable sinners, and woorthy of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:126"/> damnation, repose themselues wholy, &amp; and all their hope in his meer mercy and free grace. All others on the contrarie, which do not wholy depend heerupon, but perswade themselues, that they haue some righteousnes of their own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by though not altogether, yet in some measure they deserue Gods fauour, and are woorthy of his loue: it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that howsoeuer such flatter &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselus, yet is their estate most wretched &amp; miserable before the face of God, &amp; as most wicked and vnrighteous persons shall not faile (vnlesse they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in time) to be vtterly excluded from Gods kingdome, into the Lake that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fire and Brimstone, which is the second death.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> they sought for, is, <hi>because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law:</hi> and surely this is a most euident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For faith (as we must kno) was euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the life and soule of al those things that are prescribed &amp; commanded in the law of God, insomuch that whatsoeuer was at any time performed with a true &amp; liuely faith (in the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> that was to come) the same was holy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted before the face of God: but if on the contrary, it were destitute of that faith, although it carried neuer so faire a shew before the face of men, and in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance were all one with that which was expressed and commaunded in the Lawe, yet it was but Hypocrisye and dissimulation before the face of God
<pb facs="tcp:150910:130"/> in no measure accepted, but vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of him, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 23. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11 <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is vnpossible to please God.</hi> If the Iewes had performed the ceremonious obseruations, and morrall precepts of the law of God, with a constant hope &amp; trust to haue their obedience accepted of God, through the worthinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Iesus Christ freely, and of the Lords meere goodnesse imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, who (as the Apostle saith in the tenth Chapter) <hi>is the end of the Lawe, for righteousnesse vnto euery one that beleeueth:</hi> then surely, they should not haue fayled of perfect righteousnesse, grace and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but because (being puffed vppe with a vaine conceit of their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse) they thoght to iustify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and to merite and deserue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, and because (beeing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the righteousnesse of God) they went about to establish their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse (as the Apostle also sheweth in the same tenth chapter) and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently withall, had no true relation nor
<pb facs="tcp:150910:130"/> respect in any thing they did vnto the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christes righteousnesse, to haue their obedience accepted in him: therefore by this presumption, in proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking that vpon them, which neyther themselues, nor the holiest of all their progenitors, were euer able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, they wilfully wrapped themselues in infinite transgressions; yea and so, as they remaine euen to this day, most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ouer-whelmed with the cursse of God, according as it is written, <hi>Cursed is euery man that continueth not in all thinges, which are written in the Booke of the Law to do them.</hi> Whatsoeuer the law did teach, whatsoeuer it did command, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it did promise, it alwayes aimed at Christ, and tended as a Schoole-maister (as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Galath.</hi> 3, 24. to lead men vnto him, who alone is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the fulfilling &amp; end of the same, and in whom alone, the Lord God hath established true and perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yea and euen the fulnesse and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the same. That wee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our owne weakenesse and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
<pb facs="tcp:150910:131"/> in the performance of the duties of the Law, we might know and beleeue, that for his sake onely and altogether, we are accounted righteous, all our owne righteousnesse (as the Prophet sayeth) <hi>Esay</hi> 64, 6. beeing but <hi>as filthy Clowtes.</hi> Whereas therefore the Iewes making no account of this free iustification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered vnto them in Iesus Christ, would needes place and establish perfect Righteousnesse in their owne workes, &amp; in the outwarde obedience and obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law; it is no maruell if they lost their labour, and were vtterly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of that which they sought for. Much might be spoken, but heereby it is manifest, that true righteousnesse, grace and saluation, is obtained onely by fayth in Christ, and not in any measure by any workes or obseruations whatsoeuer: yea and which is more, that Faith and good-workes are so farre from concurring or beeing ioyned together, in the question and action of Iustification; as that they are directly opposite, and flat contrary, the one to the other. If the Iewes, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:150910:131"/> vtterly voyde of all opinion of their owne Righteousnesse, and making no account of merriting any thing by their owne workes, had come vnto God, by Faith onely in Christ Iesus, their estate should haue beene most happy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: but because they either vtterly reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Christ, or making no such account of him, as of a perfect Sauiour, reposed trust and confidence, in part, or whollye in their owne actions; therefore they were depriued of the enioying of that, which they so much gloried vpon. For of all other people in the Worlde, they boasted themselues to be in the happiest condition; and all others (in comparison of them) but euen most miserable and curssed generations. And thus haue you heard the first Reason at large, wherefore Israell obtayned not that which hee sought for, because he sought not for it by Fayth (as he should haue doone) but by the Workes of the Lawe. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> Reason, which the Apostle there rendereth, wherfore the Iewes obtained not that which they soght for, is in these
<pb facs="tcp:150910:132"/> words, <hi>For they haue stumbled at the stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling stone,</hi> that is, they were offended at the humiliation &amp; low estate of Christs person. The Apostle plainly giuing to vnderstand, that forasmuch as although the Iewes knew certainely by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Scripture (as in <hi>Esay</hi> 42, 53 and in many other places) in how great humility and meekenesse Christ shoulde liue vppon the earth.

<pb facs="tcp:150910:132"/> in an ydle and voluptuous kinde of life. And therefore at the first, they flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him in great number, as people exceeding ioyous, and glad of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. But when (within a little space af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their being with him) they conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his poore and meane estate, who yet as the Apostle speaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9, <hi>For our sakes became poore, that we through his pouerty might bee made rich:</hi> they were highly offended at him, and thoght scorn to giue him any entertainment at all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when as they saw him conuersant among <hi>Publicans</hi> and sinners, preaching the kingdome of heauen to the poore &amp; humble in spirit, discouering and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the hipocrisie of the Pharisies, their superstitious affections, Traditions and deuises; they despised &amp; persecuted him with many outragious reproaches, euen vnto the death, as an vtter enemy to the Law of God, and not worthy to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. Thus you see, howe the Iewes stumbled at Christ, and therefore consequently, no maruell at all, though they failed of their expectation, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:150910:133"/> not that which they sought for. It being most sure &amp; certaine (as we may necessarily obserue yet a little further in the consideration of this reason) that as our Lord Iesus Christ is a merciful Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and redeemer of all those from the guiltinesse of their sinnes, and from the curse and wrath of God due to their sins, which are not ashamed of his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meeknesse, but in humblenesse of soule, do confesse and beleeue him to be the son of God, and the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> and deliuerer, and by a true &amp; liuely faith do take hold vpon the free grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in the imputation of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes for their perticuler reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; saluation, according as hee sayth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11, 6. <hi>Blessed is he that shal not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in me.</hi> And Ioh. 6. <hi>Hee that beleeueth in me, hath eternal life;</hi> euen so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whosoeuer are either offended at his crosse &amp; poore estate, or making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to obtain the fauor of God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, in part or in whol, by their own righteousnes, or by any other means whatsoeuer, &amp; not by faith onely in his
<pb facs="tcp:150910:133"/> obedience &amp; satisfaction: vnto al such is Christ a stumbling blocke, whereat they stumble &amp; fall to their vtter confusion, without euer being able to recouer thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Heerof I say again, we haue a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full president in the <hi>Iews,</hi> very desirous of the comming of Christ before he came; but when he was come, they would not receiue him, as <hi>Io.</hi> 1, 11. <hi>He came to his own, &amp; his owne receiued him not.</hi> They boasted themselues to be the church of God, and yet the greatest part of them, especially the Priestes, the Scribes and Pharisies, which had the gouerment of the church, were his deadly enemies, and most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily &amp; despightfully reproched and reiected him from them; and therefore were worthily reiected themselues from the couenant of Gods grace &amp; fauour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prophesie of iust <hi>Simeon,</hi> fortelling as <hi>Lu.</hi> 2, 34. <hi>That he should be the fal &amp; rising againe of many in Israel,</hi> yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the fall of so many, as by such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity &amp; scornefulnesse should stumble at him, and refuse to take his yoake vpon them, and not onely if they be vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> life onely, in a true and liuely faith in his name: all such I say generally, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception do stumble at Christ, and all these, if they continue (as the Iewes do) without true repentaunce, must of necessity perish for euermore, according to this general sentence of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, speaking after this manner of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 21, 44. <hi>Whosoeuer shal fal on this stone, he shalbe broken, but on whomsoeuer it shal fal, it wil grinde him to powder.</hi> Thus and by these Reasons, I trust, you may well discerne, howe rightly the Apostle sayth heere of the Iewes, that they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not that which they sought for. And so consequently, that it is a most cleare truth, that the foundation of election &amp; saluation, is comprehended onely in the meere mercy of god, and not in any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that may either be within or
<pb facs="tcp:150910:134"/> without a man; that it is to be attributed neither to our will, nor to any workes or actions that we can doo, that we are in the state of grace and saluation, but the whole praise and glory thereof, ought of right to be imputed to the free goodnes and mercy of God. According as besides this example of the <hi>Isralites,</hi> who sought much and found nothing, whereas the Gentiles scarse set a foote forward, and yet obtained the price; this may bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by diuers other. They which cam at the first hour into the Vineyard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20, 10. did labor most, but yet they which came at the eleuenth houre, were rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as well as they. The working wil of the Pharisey, <hi>Luke</hi> 18, 14. seemed to bee best, but yet the Lords will was, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the poor Publican before him. The elder Sonne, <hi>Luke</hi> 15, 23. had a better wil to tarry with his Father, and so did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but yet the fat Calfe was giuen to the younger son which ran away. By all which examples, we may see (as I noted before) that election and saluation goeth not by the will and endeuour of man, but
<pb facs="tcp:150910:135"/> by the will of God onely and altogether, as it pleaseth him to accept and dispose, according as <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 13. it is said, that the faithfull are not made the Sons of God, <hi>By the wil of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;</hi> though men do labour neuer so much, and apply al the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties both of their soules and bodyes, day &amp; night, neuer so diligently, to make themselues worthy of Gods loue, yet in this respect they do but lose their trauel, when they haue done al they can, it must proceed freely of Gods meere grace and goodwil, or else they can neuer inioy the same. Now to come to such vses as this <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> doctrin doth afford vs; first it directly ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth to confute the grosse assertion of the papists touching freewil, wheras they hold &amp; affirme, that the cause of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; saluation is not of our selus, but in our selues, and that by nature we haue such an absolute power abiding in vs, as that we are able freely either to take or refuse as we thinke good, and so thereby to deserue our saluation. As touching which blasphemous assertion, forasmuch
<pb facs="tcp:150910:135"/> as this text dooth manifestly confute it, vtterly depriuing man of all sparks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, although he seeke and labor neuer so much, I neede not therefore stande much vpon it. Onely whereas they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and say, that if man haue no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to that which is good, then is he no better then a stocke or stone: I answere, that although we haue no power of our selues to thinke a good thought, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided and directed by the Spirite of God, we are able to do all things: to the which dignity, stocks and stones can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer attaine vnto, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 14. <hi>As many as are led by the spirite of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> And for this cause, saith also the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ezek. that he wil cause his people to walk in his waies.</hi> So then if the Lord be present with vs by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we shal haue good thoghts, good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, holy purposes &amp; endeuors, we shal <hi>loue the Lord with al our heart, with al our soul, &amp; with al our mind,</hi> but if the lord assist vs not with his heauenly grace, we shall haue no good thought, affection, purpose, or endeuor at al, much lesse any
<pb facs="tcp:150910:136"/> action that can bee good and holy in the sight of God. <hi>Heerein is loue</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) 1 Epist. 4, 10. <hi>not that we loued God, but that he loued vs.</hi> Now if he loued vs before we loued him (as the Apostle saith expresly) then is it most plaine, that our Loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, could not bee, because of his louing and electing vs: neither is it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpose, that they make a distinction betwixt the principall and the secondary cause, saying, that the grace &amp; assistance of God, is the principall cause; and that the secondary cause of our conuersion, consisteth in our owne wil: Whereas it is most certaine (the Apostle in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent verse proueth most clearly) that our election, calling, and iustification, lyeth wholy and only in Gods mercy, and not either wholy, or principally, or any thing at all in our owne will, but whome God hath elected before time, them he calleth and iustifyeth in time, and being of them selues vnwilling, by his grace he maketh them willing to come vnto him, and to walke in holinesse, whereunto hee hath elected them. Whereupon it plainely
<pb facs="tcp:150910:136"/> followeth, that man hath no free-will, vntil it be freed by Gods grace, our own wil can work nothing in our conuersion vntill it selfe be conuerted: wee haue no power to chaunge our will into better, vnlesse this prerogatiue be giuen of god. As this assertion of the Papists is heerby <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> thus clearly confuted, euen so dooth the Doctrine teach vs further, that being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured through the witnesse of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our hearts, that wee haue attayned that which we sought for, that we are in the state of grace, mercy, and saluation; we must be so farre from attributing this blessed condition to any worthinesse or deserts of ours, as cleane contrary-wise, wholy and altogether to the meer good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and free loue of God in Iesus christ confessing (as the truth is) that if he had not preuented vs with his grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his mercy, before wee had any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to seeke him, as we are by nature the children of wrath; so should wee for euer haue remained in the state of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And heerewithall also, that we bee so farre from taking occasion or
<pb facs="tcp:150910:137"/> encouragement, by this speciall fauor to sleepe in sin &amp; security, as by nature wee are inclined, as cleane contrariwise to be inflamed with so much the more feruent zeal to glorify god in the fruits of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in all goodnes, righteousnes &amp; truth all the daies of our life, according to our seueral places &amp; calings, &amp; the diuers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions that are offred. Next, al men are <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> heer to be admonished, that they take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heed (as they tender the glorie of God, &amp; their owne saluation) what they seek &amp; labor for, and how they labor and endeuor to accomplish that which they wold haue. For if the <hi>Isralites</hi> lost their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, &amp; if God disappointed them of their expectation, yea although they sought for righteousnes and saluation, because they sought it not aright, but in their see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king displeased God, it is clearly &amp; reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be concluded from hence, and frō their example, that much more shall such lose their labor, &amp; be disapointed of their purposes, which seek after things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, vaine, &amp; prophan, which labor for the accomplishing of their own corrupt wils and vnregenerat affections, to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, &amp; to the troble, hurt or vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb facs="tcp:150910:137"/> of his seruants: it is out of question I say, that howsoeuer God suffer such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones for a time, yet surely (seeing he disappointed the <hi>Israelites</hi>) he cannot chuse, but that acording to his righteous iudgements, he must also disapoint them &amp; continuing without repentance, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confound them (at length) from the presence of his maiesty, &amp; from the glory of his power. Furthermore, seeing the <hi>Iewes</hi> failed of righteousnes &amp; saluation, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>4</label> because they sought it not by Fayth in Christ, it highly behoueth vs to beseech the Lord for the planting &amp; establishing of a true &amp; liuely faith in our hearts, the same being as it were the staffe &amp; stay of our saluation, insomuch that whosoeuer is indued therwith, and continueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant &amp; vnmoueable therin, it is vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that such a one should perish: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, whosoere is destitute &amp; void thereof, &amp; so continueth, it is as vnpossible that such a one shoulde be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Forasmuch as there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor any other gift or grace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it bee, that can possibly stande
<pb facs="tcp:150910:138"/> before the iudgement seate of God, or whereunto any promise of saluation is annexed, but onely this Faith, not as it is a quality in vs, or an action in our soule, but as it is sanctified &amp; set a part by God to bee the onely instrumentall meanes, whereby we aprehend the grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and apply perticulerly vnto our selues the righteousnesse &amp; redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iesus Christ. So that these two; Faith, and Christ Iesus crucified, must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes concurre and be ioyned together, and in whomsoeuer they do concur and are ioined together, that man may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to be iustified, and to stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way of saluation. But oh (say the Papists) you boast much of faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ, to righteousnesse and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but where can you finde in all the Scripture, the word onely to bee ioyned with Faith, in the question of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For answere whereunto, wee say, that although the word only, be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly ioined with faith in any one place, yet the sence and substance thereof is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to be found in many places; all being
<pb facs="tcp:150910:138"/> Negatiue, and plainly excluding workes in this behalfe, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 21, 28. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God is made manifest without the Law.</hi> And a little after, <hi>without the workes of the law.</hi> Ephes. 2, 8. <hi>Not of your selues, not of workes.</hi> Rom. 4, 6. <hi>God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth righteousnesse without workes.</hi> Ro. 9, 11 <hi>Not by workes.</hi> Tit. 3, 5. <hi>Not by the workes of righteousnesse which he had done.</hi> Vpon the view and consideration of all these places, wee may clearly conclude, that they import as much, as fayth onely, for all workes of the Law, and euerie other thing being vtterly excluded, what doth or can remaine but Faith alone? Lastly, seeing the Iewes therefore obtained not that which they sought for, because in seeking they stumbled at Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came offended at his humiliation &amp; low estate; that therefore wee take diligent heed (as we tender the glory of God and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>5</label> our owne saluation) that we neuer enter into the consideration of the gospell and Religion of Iesus Christ, nor take vpon vs the profession of the same, with any carnal or worldly respect, as if our estate
<pb facs="tcp:150910:139"/> and condition in this world, should bee therby any thing at al bettered or amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For so long as we carry such minds and affections, we shall see nothing at al in the gospel and religion of Iesus christ, but sufficient matter to be vtterly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and out of heart. For euen as our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, during the time of his continuance in this worlde, carried no shewe at all of any outwarde pomp or dignity, but as the apostle saith <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, 8. <hi>Took on him the forme of a seruant, humbled himselfe, &amp; became obedient vnto the death, &amp;c.</hi> Patiently endured mockes, buffeting with fists, &amp; whatsoeuer els his wicked &amp; malicious enimies could put in practise against him, euen so, is this an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall drift, whereat the doctrine of his gospel aimeth, that we should be framed according to his example, and be like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in sufferings, before wee can bee partakers of his Glory: and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer will not take vp his Crosse and follow him, is not worthy of him. It crieth out that they are blessed, not who are of a proude and arrogant heart, but
<pb facs="tcp:150910:139"/> who are poore in Spirit, as <hi>Mathew.</hi> 5, 3. <hi>Blessed are the poore in Spirite, for theyrs is the kingdome of Heauen.</hi> It promiseth comfort, not to such as liue according to their owne hearts lust, but to such as sigh and grone vnder the waight and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy burthen of their sinnes, as <hi>Math.</hi> 11, 28. <hi>Come vnto me, al ye that are wearie and laden, and I wil ease you.</hi> It saieth not they are blessed, who enioy the riches, the dainties and delectable thinges of this life, but as wee may see also in that <hi>Mat,</hi> 5, 10. <hi>Who hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi> Not such as liue carlessely and securely at ease, and in peace, but who <hi>Suffer persecution for Righteousnesse sake.</hi> So farre is the Gospell from satisfying the earthly affections and expectations flesh and bloode, and so much will they be deceyued, which take vpon them the profession thereof, vppon any carnall or worldly consideration. According as howe fearefully the Iewes thus stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Christ; yea euen to the verie breaking and bruising of them to peeces, wee haue sufficiently considered in that
<pb facs="tcp:150910:140"/> already spoken. For this cause most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly speaketh the Apostle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 23, 24. <hi>We preach Christ crucified</hi> (saith hee) <hi>vnto the Iewes a stumbling blocke, and vnto the Grecians foolishnesse, but vnto them that are called both of the Iews &amp; Grecians, we preach Christ, the power of God, and the wisedom of God.</hi> They that in humblenesse of soule, and without being ashamed of his crosse do faithfully beleeue in him, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge his Gospell, all such shall finde the same Gospell to be vnto them a word of life; yea euen the mighty power of God to the saluation of their soules: but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer neglect or disdain to repose their trust and confidence in his redemption, and to take his yoake vpon them: Vnto all such will he be found such a stumbling stone, and such a rocke of offence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they shall stumble and fall to their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confusion, without euer beeing able to recouer themselues againe, according to that fearfull sentence of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, in <hi>Math.</hi> 21. which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred before. But nowe, as the Iewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected Christ, and were offended at him,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:140"/> because hee satisfied not their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the matters of the world; euen so standeth the case with many at this day. If the Gospell did bring ease, peace, and prosperity; If it did promise worldly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pleasures, and delectations, then should Christ haue followers and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples enow; but because it is commonly accompanyed with trouble, persecution and disquietnesse, acording to the words of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10, 34. where he sayth in plaine tearmes, <hi>That hee came not to send peace, but a sworde;</hi> because it exhorteth men to mortifie their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bee humble and lowly minded, teacheth them, that through many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations they must enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, and that so long as they bee zealous in the profession and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Gospell, they shall be sure to be hated, despised, reproached, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted of prophane and worldly minded men. And because the Riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which it promiseth are not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be enioyed, but with Fayth &amp; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be expected and hoped for, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:150910:141"/> are of this worlde, vaine and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but spirituall and eternal. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to passe, that the Flocke of Christ is such a little Flocke; this is the Reason wherefore so few goe in at the straite gate, that letteth into life; and so many on the other side, that stumble at Christ, and run headlong in the broade way which leadeth to destruction. So then, for the conclusion at this time, how highly it standeth vs vpon, to pray and beseech the Lorde, so to furnish vs with true Fayth in Christ, and with all other sanctifying graces of Gods Spirit, that wee may euermore seeke after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and saluation aright, and so as in due time our godly desires may be fulfilled, to the glory of God, and to the euerlasting peace and ioy of our soules, euery true Christian heart, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceiue, and conclude with himselfe.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these wordes, the Apostle sheweth the Reason wherefore <hi>Israel</hi> generally attained not vnto that which it sought for; as namely, because they were not al generally elected, but the greatest part, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> eternally reiected and forsaken. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are first to obserue this general point; that as the Lord God before the Foundation of the Worlde, hath freely elected in Iesus Christ, all those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and without exception, that are and shall bee saued; euen so, in due and conuenient time, dooth hee cal and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from the rest, whom he doth not acknowledge for his owne, and not onely planteth in their hearts, a true and liuely Fayth, in the promises of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:150910:142"/> grace and mercy, to the free and perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler forgiuenesse of their sinnes, to theyr Iustification and eternall life; but so also as that they became zealously enflamed to glorifie God in the fruits of the Spirit in all goodnesse, righteousnesse &amp; truth, according to their seuerall places &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the diuers occasions that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And as before the foundation of the world, he hath on the contrary eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reprobated all such without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which do not belong to eternal life; euen so, from time to time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his iust and righteous Iudgments doth he with-hold from them the grace of his blessed Spirit, so as they can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeue truly, nor embrace the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel when it is preached vnto them; nor glorify God, nor seal the assurance of their owne saluation, in the performance of any duty of obedience, which he requireth at their hands. Thus stood the case with the Iewes; Some of them beleeued in Christ, and so attained to righteousnesse and saluation, &amp; these were such as were ordained to eternall
<pb facs="tcp:150910:142"/> life, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13, 48. <hi>As many as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eternall life, beleeued:</hi> but some of them were hardned, giuen vp to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sence, and neyther did nor could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, for the attaining of righteousnes and saluation, but most fearfully remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the state of condemnation. As many as haue their eyes opened, &amp; their hearts sanctified by the spirite of God, in the ministry &amp; preaching of the gospell, all such haue (whiles they are heere) a pledge and earnest of that eternall life, which is to come; and as many as haue their eyes blinded, and their hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this world, and so continue: such can haue no sounde hope or perswasion that they shall liue to life and saluation. For as the Apostle most notably sayeth. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 3, 4. <hi>If our Gospel bee hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world, hath blinded the minds, that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the Image of God, shoulde not shine vnto them.</hi> Such as are puffed vp with vain conceits of their owne righteousnesse, make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to iustify them-selues, and that (if
<pb facs="tcp:150910:143"/> not wholy, yet in part) they doe deserue Gods fauor, and are worthy of his loue: such doth the Lord worthily, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Iustice and iudgment, both blind and harden, and so as they neuer attaine to the estate of grace, mercy, and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But such as laying aside al conceit of their own righteousnesse, repose al their hope and confidence of righteousnesse and saluation, in the righteousnesse and obedience of Iesus Christ, freely and of Gods meere grace and mercy imputed vnto them, and who being humbled and cast downe with a serious sence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their sinne and wretched estate, and who sighing and groaning vnder the burthen of their corruption, do earnestly desire release &amp; deliuerance from the same; all such most graciously receyueth he to the partaking of his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall loue, imputeth vnto them the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and obedience of Iesus Christ and so as they remaine altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all danger of condemnation. These are such as Christ, <hi>Mathew</hi> 5, 3. doth call <hi>Poore in Spirit,</hi> and who in the iudgment
<pb facs="tcp:150910:143"/> of the worlde, as the Apostle speaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 18. are accounted but fooles, &amp; whom our Lord Iesus Christ also, <hi>Math.</hi> 11, 28. terming weary and laden, most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly exhorteth to come vnto him say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Come vnto mee all ye that are weary &amp; laden, and I wil ease you.</hi> These I say are they, whose eyes it pleaseth the Lord to illuminate in the Ministery and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell, euen as hee enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the eyes of the Blind-man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. when hee discouered himselfe vnto him to be the sonne of God, according as in this sence, most notably sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 6. <hi>That God giueth the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the faith of Iesus Christ.</hi> For as soone as the hart is conuerted vnto God, <hi>The vaile</hi> (as the Apostle calleth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 15.) <hi>is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> and this comfortable voice of the Sonne of God, soundeth alowde, <hi>The dead shal liue,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 21. <hi>As the Father rayseth vp the dead and quickeneth them, so the Sonne quickeneth whome hee wil.</hi> But now, that the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which is onely in it selfe the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb facs="tcp:150910:144"/> of our life, and the power of God to saluation, should thus be a sauour of life, and a worde of saluation; but vnto some; and a sauour of death, to the death and destruction of many that hear it, be effectuall to open the eyes, and to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the hearts of some) and to blinde the eyes, and harden the hearts of others. This commeth to passe, as in the Lordes speciall loue and fauour toward his elect and chosen Saints, in regard of whome reioyceth our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>Lu.</hi> 10, 21. and giueth thankes to his Heauenly father; euen so thorough his iust Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vppon the malice, infidelity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse, and hard heartednesse of proud conceited persons, as many such there are, who are ready to take offence at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good thing, and to peruert the same to their destruction; yea thus taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by the word of life and health, to haue their venom stirred vp, for the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning and infecting of their soules and bodies, much more dangerously then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; no otherwise then a sore eie by the light of the Sun, and by looking stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Onely in a word or two, I will make some further Vse thereof, and then proceede to that which followeth. First, seeing as God hath elected some to saluation, so hath he also laid down the means in his word, whereby we may come to the knowledg of our perticuler election; that therfore (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> counselleth, 2. Epist. 1, 10) we
<pb facs="tcp:150910:147"/> giue all diligence, <hi>To make our calling and election sure.</hi> In the worlde men are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painefull enough to make assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Lands and goodes vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues &amp; their posterities: what a shame is it then for vs, that we should be slacke in making sure to our selues the election of God, which is more worth then al the world besides? Now how we shall come to this assurance, the same holy Apostle a little before in that very chapter, doth most familiarly teach. <hi>In that ye flee</hi> (saith he) <hi>the corruption which is in the world tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough lust, therefore giue euen all diligence thereunto: ioyne moreouer vertue with your faith, and with Vertue Knowledge, and with Knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlinesse, and with godlinesse Brotherly kindnesse, and with Brotherly kindnesse, loue: For if these things be among you and abound, they wil make you that ye neuer shalbe idle nor vnfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And a little after, <hi>If ye do these things</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye shal neuer fal.</hi> So then, if we perceiue our selues to be endued with a true and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:148"/> liuely Faith in Iesus Christ, to the free &amp; particular forgiuenes of our sins, to our iustification and eternall life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall feele our selues guided and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the spirit of God to the works &amp; effects of faith in all goodnesse, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and truth, according to our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall places and callings, and the diuers occasions that are offred, then haue we a comfortable assurance, to the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace and ioy of our soules; that we are of the number of them whome God hath elected before the Foundation of the world, and so surely setled in the state of grace, mercy &amp; saluation that nothing shalbe able to make void the same; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwise, if wee feele not these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, if we want this faith, and haue not this gracious direction of Gods spirite, how diligētly soeuer we may otherwise seek it, &amp; how desirous soeuer we may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be of grace, righteousnes &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, yet with the <hi>Iewes</hi> shall wee but lose our labor, &amp; neuer attain the end of our desire. After this maner if we examin our selues, and the state and condition of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:148"/> the time wherin we now liue, shal we say that they haue a true and liuely faith in Christ Iesus, who neither knowe what Christ is, either touching his person, or touching his office? or shall we say, that such are guided by Gods spirit, and ioyne vertue with their faith, who are so far frō flying the coruption that is in the world through lust, as that they lust after euery thing that is euil therein? who are either vain swearers, drunkards, whoremongers prophane scoffers, vaine boasters, giuen to contention, back-biting, or such like? Surely these, &amp; such as these are, do not walk in the way of righteousnes &amp; salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; therefore (so long as they remain such) c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:150910:149"/> consolation. For as they are heereby put out of doubt, that they cannot perrish, (because as Gods Nature is vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, so is his counsell and will:) so bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in time called, regenerated, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed (as all Gods elect are and shalbe) they heereby become also priuiledged, from so sinning &amp; going astray as others do. For why? the sinnes and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they commit, are neuer (after their calling and sanctification) with full purpose of heart, as are the sins &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of wicked and vngodly men, but through infirmity, negligence, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, forgetfulnesse, and not with any delight or affectiō of sinning. The desires of their hearts, and the endeuors of their liues, being set to serue and please God according to his worde, howsoeuer (as the Apostle speaketh of such, <hi>Ro.</hi> 7.) they cannot performe it as they would. And hauing thus thorough infirmity passed their boundes, they will not obstinately defend and iustifie that which they see to be amisse, but with greefe and sorrow of heart, bewayle and detest it. Wheras on
<pb facs="tcp:150910:149"/> the contrary, when either the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the wicked do reproue them, or others doo exhort and admonish them; Nay although the sinne whereof they are guilty be neuer so manifest and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; yea and so as all men cry shame vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for the same, yet will they not blush, nor be ashamed themselues; they will iustify it, and still hold on it, till they haue made their faces <hi>As strong as a stone, and as hard as the neather Milstone,</hi> as it is <hi>Iob</hi> 41, 15. So you see heere another no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Vse of the certainty of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It so assures Gods children of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, that nothing can seperate them from the enioying of it. And it doth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge and preserue them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting such sinnes as the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly do fall into. It followeth in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, <hi>And the rest haue bin hardned.</hi> When he thus addeth of the residue that <hi>They haue bin hardned.</hi> The sence of the words being considered before, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler point of Doctrine is this, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is the very tree, root, &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> of blindnesse and hardnes of heart,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:150"/> for the wicked beeing forsaken of God, can do nothing in all their deeds, words, and counsels, but prouoke, heape, and pull vpon them the cursse and wrath of God. How on the one side, God is said to harden the wicked and vngodlye Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and how on the other side they harden themselues, we haue sufficiently considered, in that which hath beene spoken at sundry times before, and wee shall haue fit occasion to call some part of it to minde agayne, in the Verse next following; and therefore, I wil not heer stand vppon it, but onely proceede to shew according to the mayne scope and drifte of the Apostle in this present text, that as the Reprobate, through the iust Iudgement of God vppon them, haue neuer the grace to seeke for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Saluation, as they should doo, with a true Fayth in Christes name; but haue euer-more a vaine trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their owne woorthinesse, and make account to bee iustified by theyr owne merrites; euen so, haue they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies not onely beene most woorthily
<pb facs="tcp:150910:150"/> depriued and disappointed of their hope and expectation; but iustly also giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into a Reprobate sence. Heereof was there sufficient experience amongst the Israelites, insomuch that (the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of them, being eternally reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and forsaken of the Lorde) although they haue neuer so diligently applyed themselues thereunto, yet (being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the gracious direction of Gods Spirite) the more paines they tooke, the more labour they lost; the more they perswaded themselues to go forward, so much the more were they cast behinde; the more they thought them-selues to see the right way, so much the more were they most miserablye blinded in Ignoraunce, Infidelitie, and Hardnesse of heart; and the neerer they perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them-selues to bee, to the enioying of Gods grace and fauour, so much the neerer they were vnto their owne fearefull ouerthrow, confusion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And according heereunto, continueth (as I sayde) at this day, and from day to day, the state and condition
<pb facs="tcp:150910:151"/> of all other reprobates, insomuch, that whatsoeuer they set themselues about; yea and although they carry neuer so fair a countenance in the face of the worlde, of zeale, of godlinesse and Religion, seem neuer so deuout and well affected; yet is it vtterly vnpossible for them, either to haue true faith planted in their hearts, to take sure holde vppon the free mercy of God in Christ Iesus for their saluation, or to haue their eyes opened, and theyr bodies and soules regenerate and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to see the Lords wil for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Maiesty in the cheerefull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the same, according to his word: but still will they proceede, to heape one transgression vpon another, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of conscience, vntill they become vtterly ouer-whelmed with the eternall curse of God, from the presence of Gods Maiesty, and from the glory of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; yea, and it is also most cleare &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, not onely by the History of the Scripture, but by experience, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the word of God (in the faithfull Ministry and preaching of it) sound ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:150910:151"/> so loud in their eares, yet is it vtterly vnpossible that their hearts should bee truely conuerted, whatsoeuer be said or done, as they haue begun to be froward and obstinat against the Lord, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies to al such, as sincerely preach and professe his truth; so will they grow and go forward from one degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and mischiefe vnto another, vntill they haue heaped vppe the full measure thereof for their iust condemnation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as this is manifest in the example of <hi>Pharao.</hi> Exod. 9, 34, 35. who although he were oftentimes exhorted and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to yeeld and submit himselfe, and that with expresse messages from Gods owne mouth, yet being a wicked repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, his heart nothing at all relented, but he waxed worse and worse. So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and immutable is the eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and decree of God, <hi>With whom</hi> (as S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, chap. 1, 17.) <hi>there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riablenesse, neither shaddowing by turning.</hi> And who, as <hi>he hath made the wicked man for the day of euil</hi> (as Salomon speaketh, Prou. 16, 4.) so doth he reserue &amp; keepe
<pb facs="tcp:150910:152"/> him for the same, and from which it is vtterly vnpossible, that he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. But now (by the way) if any such presumptuous cogitation arise in anye mans minde, as to demand why God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth one, and reiecteth another; molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the hearts of some, and planteth in them faith, repentance, &amp; other like gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of sanctification, and so exalteth thē by degrees to eternall life; and so giueth others ouer to blindnesse and hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse, as that they can neither truely beleeue, nor repent, but run head-long by degrees to eternall destruction: The Apostle aunswereth this curious questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 20, 21. <hi>O man</hi> (sayth he) <hi>who art thou that pleadest against God? Shall the thing formed, say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power of the Clay, to make of the same lump, one vessell to honour, and another to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> It seemeth also, vnto naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to bee verie contrarie, that GOD will haue his Word and Gospell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to such wicked and vngodly men, and that they should not only be taught
<pb facs="tcp:150910:152"/> and instructed therby, reproued for their sinnes, and exhorted to repentance, but be also offered Grace, mercy, and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they forsake their sinnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time in newnesse of life: when as yet before hand, the Lorde hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determined, that they shall neither repent, nor truely beleeue, but rather harden their hearts in Infidelity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse more and more. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <hi>Pharao</hi> to let the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell depart; whereby it may appeare, that it was his will that it should be so; and yet agayne (as it were cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie) hee sayde to <hi>Moses,</hi> that hee had hardened his heart, that hee should not let them goe: By Reason of these, and such like sentences and examples, the Naturall man is readie to immagine, that God is vnconstant, and that there is no certainety in his will. But it is the part and duty of euerie good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, whensoeuer any such carnall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations doo arise within their mindes, which do presently suppresse and keepe them vnder, alwayes remembering this
<pb facs="tcp:150910:153"/> fearefull saying of the Lorde, <hi>Esay</hi> 6, 9. which not onely our Lorde Iesus Christ in the Gospell, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 14. but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle also alledgeth and thundereth out against the wicked in the last chapter of the Acts. <hi>Go vnto this people and say, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ye shall hear, and not vnderstand, &amp; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye shal see, and not perceiue. For the hart of this people is waxed fat, and their eares are dull of hearing, and with their eyes haue they winked, least they should see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnderstande with their hearts, and should returne, that I might heale them.</hi> To which effect also, speaketh our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9, 39. <hi>I am come vnto iudgement into this world, that they which see not, might see, &amp; that they which see, might bee made blinde.</hi> Both which places doo plainly declare, that howsoeuer the Lords will bee, that some for euer shall remaine in hardnesse of heart, without any effectuall calling; yet the worde and Gospell of Christ is preached, neither to their reproofe, nor to their exhortation in vaine. Christ sent his Apostles to preach the Gospell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
<pb facs="tcp:150910:153"/> the world, and although he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted none, to whom the Gospel shold not be preached, yet hee opened not the hearts of all, but euen of the fewest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to receiue and entertaine it in their hearts. The elect onely doo truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Doctrine of saluation, and they alone are truly humbled by Gods spirite, to walke in knowledge, faith, repentance and obedience, according thereunto. But the Reprobate, hauing no true regarde either of sound knowledge, or of faith, or of any other such like grace, are hardned by the hearing of Gods word, and haue their sinnes made much more greeuous then before, in that by this meanes, al ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of ignoraunce is vtterly taken from them, according to Christs wordes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15, 22. <hi>If I had not come &amp; spoken vnto thē, they should not haue had sinne, but nowe haue they no cloake for their sinne.</hi> He doth not say, that if he had not come, they should haue beene without sinne, but that their sinne should haue been lesse grieuous, &amp; more tollerable; for after they had once heard Christ, and had bin taught, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:150910:154"/> and admonished by him, al excuse of ignorance was vtterly taken from them. And thus you see, that it is most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and necessary, that (howsoeuer the wicked and vngodly reprobates cannot possibly be truly conuerted &amp; broght to faith &amp; repentance yet) the word of God should neuertheles be preached to them. That therby they may be made without excuse, and not be able to say when they stand before the iudgement seat of God, that they would haue learned, beleeued, &amp; obeyed, if they might haue bin taught, but clean contrariwise enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that they haue bin taught &amp; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; most plainly shewed the good and right way, but wilfully haue they blinded their eies, &amp; hardned their harts, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most iust and righteous is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Now for the vses. A first Vse <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> arising hence, very necessarily appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to al the faithfull Ministers of Iesus Christ, as namely, that there is no cause, wherefore they should bee discouraged, althogh they see the labor &amp; pains which they take in preaching the gospel, to take
<pb facs="tcp:150910:154"/> little or no effect at all, to the calling and saluation of the greatest parte of those that heare it, but that many slightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, and scornfully reiect it and them selues (in regard thereof) not only to be rewarded with prophane scoffes &amp; most despighful reproches by word of mouth, but with the greatest extreamities that malicious hearts can possibly inuent; but that alwaies vpon such experiences, they comforte them-selues with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance and consideration of Gods eternall and vnchaungeable purpose and Decree, being fully assured, that such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall beleeue, and yeelde obedience, who are elected, as was taught before. A great greefe (indeede) it cannot chuse but bee vnto the Seruants of God, to be thus recompenced for the paines which they take, and for the tender care which they haue of the good and saluation of such as are committed vnto them: but when they haue recourse vnto Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; and there see and consider, that he appointed this to bee the lot of such as are most faithfull in his seruice: and that

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> men, and leaues them to them-selues, it is very forcible to strike a feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb facs="tcp:150910:157"/> into euerie one of vs. For what is the best of vs, but a lumpe of Clay? And howsoeuer in Gods counsell, wee are chosen to saluation, yet in our selues wee are all shut vp vnder vnbeleefe, and are fit for nothing but to bee Vessels of wrath and condemnation. Our Lorde Iesus Christ, called <hi>Iudas</hi> a Traitor, and wee knowe his lewde life and fearefull end. Now what are wee better then <hi>Iudas</hi> by Nature? If wee had beene in his stead, without Gods speciall Grace, we should haue doone as he did. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we see by experience, that when men want Grace, they make no Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any thing, neither what they say, nor what they doo. And heerewithall, let vs be-thinke our selues of this one thing, whether there be not many alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy condemned in hell, who in their liues neuer so grossely or greeuously sinned, as some of vs. All this (I say) duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, is verie forcible to mooue vs to feare and trembling, and to make vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse (as the trueth is) that it is onely the Lordes mercie, that wee bee not vtterly

               <pb facs="tcp:150910:159"/> confounded. Last of all, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle distinguisheth betwixte <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as how Israel sought righteousnesse rightly and amisse, obtained and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, was elected and hardned, and so consequently saued and not saued, as by conference with that which goeth before and followeth after, the matter is most plaine, we may necessarily obserue, for our further lerning and instruction, that as there were true and false Israelites, in the time of Christ and of his Apostles, so are there true and false christians in these dayes of ours. That there were true and false Israelites, besides this Text, and the whole scope and main drift of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, in this and the former chapters. Our Lord Iesus Christ doth clearely resolue, in the description which himself maketh of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> Iohn 1, 47. <hi>Behold indeed an Israelite</hi> (saith he) <hi>in whom is no guile.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Rom. 9, 6. <hi>Al they are not Israel, which are of Israel.</hi> And in the second Chapter before, <hi>He is not a Iew that is one outward, neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Iew which is one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:159"/> and the circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not in the Letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.</hi> And again, most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Iohn 8. where our Lord Iesus Christ in seuerall sences, both granteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, the Iewes to be the seede and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham.</hi> That there are true &amp; false Christians at this day, and so shalbe vnto the end of the worlde, the former places for testimonies of scripture, doo sufficiently declare. And it might bee confirmed by many other authorities of the Gospell, euidently describing the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church to consist of good and bad, and clearely fore-telling, that euen as in a Corne fielde, there is not onely good Corne, but Tares and Weeds; and as in a threshing floore, pure wheat &amp; chaffe, and as in a Net that is cast into the Sea, there comes vp not onely good thinges, but also bad; so should there bee Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and carnall Gospellers from time to time, not onely such as with vpright hearts and good Consciences doo serue and obey the Lord Christ, but such also as are euen Reprobate to euery Good
<pb facs="tcp:150910:160"/> worke, and whose end is to bee cast out from the presence of God, and to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as chaffe, in the fearful furnace of his wrath &amp; displeasure. But to come nowe to a briefe description of both these sorts and how they may bee knowne &amp; discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the one from the other. And ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing the papists, whom all men of any sound iudgement do wel enough vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to be no true but false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet Christians, I will obserue some fewe differences to make this distinction ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, euen among such as are accounted professors of the Gospell. Our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ describing <hi>Nathaniel</hi> to bee a true Isralite, sayth of him in plain terms, <hi>That in him was no guile.</hi> A briefe descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of large Contents. For it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that hee was of a sound and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart before God, voyde of all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisye and dissimulation, one that in truth and sincerity applyed himselfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Vocation and calling, a man that was not double tongued, not crafty, nor wise, according to the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, but plaine and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:150910:160"/> truely, and without deceite in al his thoughts, wordes, and actions; He was a man also (as wee may see by Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of places) well grounded &amp; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Word of God, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make that the foundation of both his profession and practise. The time being almost spent, I will now goe no further, then to this patterne of <hi>Nathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> for the sight and beholding of a sound and good Christian. I will not say, that as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was, so euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ought to bee, but being now ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into this Description, I must say, that as <hi>Nathaniell</hi> was, so euerie true Christian eyther is, or endeuoureth to bee. As hee was of an vpright and sounde heart, voyde of all Hyppocrisie and Dissimulation, and so foorth (as you heard before;) so euerie one that is a good Christian, eyther is, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise endeauoureth to be of a sound and vpright heart, voyde of all Hypocrisie and Dissimulation both in Trueth and Sincerity; as also applying himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Vocation and Calling,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:161"/> he will not be double tongued, nor giue himself to craft and subtilty, he wil mean simply and plainly, and bee without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite in his words and actions; he wil la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to attaine vnto the sound knoledge of Gods worde, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>
               </label> and to make that the foundation of his profession and practise. Doost thou then see or know any man, either in the perticuler place of thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, or elsewhere, that is either a vaine Swearer, or giuen to any other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sinne whatsoeuer, and being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished either by the Ministry of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or otherwise; continueth obstinate and vnreformed? Knowe such a one to be no <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> but a counterfet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian? Dost thou know a man that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth a zealous regard to haue al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges reformed according to Gods word, and is a seuere censurer of other men; &amp; yet in the meane season makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to coozen and defraude, will not refraine his tongue, but suffers it to raile vpon, and to reproach the Ministers and Preachers of the Gospell; or who being kindly entertained as a familiar compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:161"/> either at the Table, or otherwise, takes aduantage thereupon, to hurt and disgrace, by discouering that which was priuately spoken, and by adding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, as time and occasion may best serue his turne? Know such a one also, (what shew soeuer he make to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to be no such Christian as <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was, but a false Brother, a notable &amp; notorious Hypocrite. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> beeing a true Israelite indeede, would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Conscience, and giue no testimony of any will or endeuour to discharge a good Conscience. As he was careful to speake the truth from his heart, so was it farre from him, to aduise or perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either to conceale the truth, or to sweare or protest, desperately and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their knowledge or perswasion. He would not preferre his owne wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the loue of his Neighbours, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect such wholesome exhortations as tend to the establishing of peace &amp; loue, he woulde not say and vnsay at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, nor make account to braue &amp; face out matters against right and equity, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:150910:162"/> contrary to euident testimonies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> (I say) beeing a true Israelite indeed, would doo none of these things, neyther wil he that is a true Christian indeed, do any of them at this day; but remembring what <hi>Salomon</hi> saith <hi>Prou.</hi> 28, 26. <hi>Hee that trusteth in his owne heart is a Foole, but he that walketh in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shalbe deliuered.</hi> And in Ch. 26. that there is more hope of a Fool, then of him that is wise in his owne conceit; hee will loue admonitions euen as his life, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of those whom God hath sent to that end, and do not dissemble, but deale simply and faithfully with him in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, as blessed &amp; precious instruments of his saluation, saying with the Prophet <hi>Dauid.</hi> Psal. 141, 5. <hi>Let the righteous smite me, and it shal bee a benefit, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue me, and it shalbe a precious Oyle, that shal not breake my head.</hi> He will be carefull to make the Word of God a Lanthorne for his feete, and a light vnto his pathes, remaining resolute in such thinges one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as are grounded thereupon, and not presuming to turne aside from the same,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:162"/> either to the right hand, or to the lefte.

            <p>THE Apostle hauing before made a diuision of the Iewes, as some to
<pb facs="tcp:150910:163"/> be elected, and belonging to eternal life; and some on the contrary, to be blinded and hardened. Now forasmuch as hee knew well, that this Doctrine woulde seeme very odious and loathsome in the hearing of the Iewes, that hee shoulde seeme to affirme, that any of them could possibly be either hardened or forsaken, seeing they were al the children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and lineally descended of the stocke and generation of those holy fathers, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome, and vnto whose seede, God made his couenant &amp; promises of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting mercy; he therefore in this place, manifestly approueth, that which he had spoken before of their reprobation and hardning, by the expresse sentences and Testimonies of the holy Scripture. As if he said, the Scripture speaketh euidently of the blindnesse and hard-hartednesse of the Iewes, and therfore there is no cause or reason (saith S. <hi>Paule</hi>) wherefore they should be offended, or take it vnkindely, although I do distinguish after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, betwixt the elect and reprobat. The sentences of the Scripture which hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<pb facs="tcp:150910:163"/> for the confirmatiō of this point, are in number three; the first two out of <hi>Esay</hi> 6, and 29. in these wordes which I haue now read vnto you, <hi>God hath giuen them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they shold not see, and eares that they should not heare.</hi> And the third is out of <hi>Psalme.</hi> 69. in that which followeth; And <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Let their Table be made a snare, &amp;c.</hi> As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two first; forasmuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, as also the Prophet, speaking of the stubbornesse and reiection of the Iewes, attributeth in both places, the sending vpon them the Spirite of slumber, the blinding of their eyes, and the stopping of their eares vnto God, saying; <hi>God hath giuen them the Spirite of slumber, &amp;c.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as also cha. 29. the prophet saith euidently, that <hi>the Lord hath couered them with a spirit of slumber.</hi> And as expressely also, Chap. 61, <hi>That they should heare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not vnderstand; and plainly see, but not perceiue.</hi> According also, as euen in this sence, is the selfesame sentence alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by our Lorde Iesus Christ himselfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. by <hi>Iohn the Euangelist,</hi> chap. 12.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:164"/> and by the Apostle▪ <hi>Actes</hi> 28. Wee are first to obserue from hence, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall point of Doctrine. That whereas <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> some remaine in blindnesse, ignoraunce, and infidelity, and so as they harden thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to commit iniquity, and neyther do nor can repent them of the same: this wilfull blindenesse, stubbornnesse, and hardnesse of hart, commeth not to passe, without, or against the will of God, but by his certaine knowledge, prouidence, and decree. According as besides the plaine and expresse words of this Text, where hee saith that <hi>God hath giuen them the spirit of slumber, &amp;c.</hi> It doth clearely appeare in plentifull other Testimonies and examples, that there is no kinde of wickednesse committed at any time, or in any place of the World, how little or great soeuer it bee, but the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, fore-seeth it, and directeth it, that it passe not in any measure, beyonde the boundes and limits which hee hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; yea, he doth not simply permit and suffer; but euen appoint and ordain that it should be so.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150910:164"/>
            <p>The Lord sayde vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> not once, but diuers times concerning <hi>Pharao,</hi> that hee had hardened his heart, and that hee woulde harden the same. Hee did not say, that hee woulde permit or suffer his heart, but hee plainely sayde, <hi>I will harden Pharaohs heart, and I haue hardened his heart, as</hi> Exodus 7, 3. and 10, 1. For which very cause, concludeth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. <hi>Romanes</hi> 9, 18. that God hardneth whom he permitteth or suffereth to bee hardned; but that he hardneth whom he will.</p>
            <p>The Apostle saw no cause, why mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was shewed vnto some; and why o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were left in Infidelity and hardnes of heart, but onely the will of God; and although the Reprobate haue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and do cary with them from their Mothers Wombe, sufficient matter of their hardning; yet if we looke into the first and Originall cause after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, it is comprehended no otherwise, then onely in the will of God, so that as hee hath mercy on whom he will; so whom hee will, hee hardeneth. As of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb facs="tcp:150910:165"/> goodnesse and mercy, hee worketh by his spirit, in his chosen children, Faith Repentance, Patience, Meekenesse, and a true sence and feeling of his mercy. So dooth his iust iudgement and iust wrath, conceiued against sinne, work by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sathan, hardnesse, and a sence and feeling of his iust displesure in the other. This may be made more plaine by diuers examples. No man can deny, but that it is a great and greeuous sin, that a false Prophet shoulde come and deceiue the people of God; Neither againe can it be denied, but that it is a great sinne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a Prophet: and yet doth the Lorde in the Scripture, attribute vnto him-selfe both the one and the other. For this is most certaine, that no false Prophet hath at any time risen, whom the Lord for one of these two causes hath not stirred vp, either by him to try the constancy and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of his chosen Seruants, or else to blinde and harden those, that delight not in the truth. Now <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut, 13, 1, 2, 3. speaketh on this manner; <hi>If there arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you a Prophet, or a dreamer of dreames
<pb facs="tcp:150910:165"/> and giue thee a signe or wonder, and the sign and the wonder which he hath told thee, come to passe, saying; Let vs goe after other Gods, which thou hast not knowne, and let vs serue them: Thou shalt not hearken to the words of the Prophet, or vnto that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God prooues you, to knowe whether ye loue the Lord your God, with all your heart, and with al your soule.</hi> Nowe,<note place="margin">Tentat deus nō ad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum sed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationē non vt malum fiat sed vt bonū patefiat</note> if it bee the proper office of God, to trie, tempt, and examine the harts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Holy-Ghost in these wordes, doth affirme; then is it plaine, that false Prophets be Gods instruments, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this purpose. And now, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the second, that God deceiueth the Prophet, the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 14. witnesseth the same in plain termes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>If the Prophet be deceiued when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord haue deceiued that Prophet, and I wil stretch out mine hand vpon him, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, this deceiuing dooth the Lorde yet more plainely challenge vnto himselfe, 1 Kinges 22, 20, 21, 22. by that solemne proclamation made in the eares of the Prophet <hi>Michaiah,</hi> and boldlye by
<pb facs="tcp:150910:166"/> him againe pronounced in the audience of two Kings, <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iehoshaphat. And the Lord sayde, who shal entise Ahab, that he may go and fal at Ramoth Gilead? And one sayde on this manner, and another saide on that manner. That there came foorth a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and stoode before the Lorde, and saide; I will entise him: And the Lord sayde vnto him, where-with? And hee sayde, I wil goe out, and bee a false spirite, in the mouth of all his Prophets. Then hee saide, thou shalt entise him, and shalt also preuaile, goo forth, and do so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make a publick proclamation to call forth one to deceiue, to send him forth, and to giue him power to preuail, that this is not a simple permission, or a thing which God suffereth against his will; it is so cleare, that we cannot desire any thing more apparant. Agayne, no man can deny, but the incest of <hi>Absolom</hi> was no little, but an horrible sinne, and yet that it was not committed without Gods Decree, it is plaine by the wordes of the Lord spoken to <hi>Dauid</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 11. <hi>Thus sayth the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:166"/> Lord, Behold, I wil raise vp euil against thee out of thine owne house, and will take thy wiues before thine eyes, and giue them vnto thine Neighbour, and hee shal lye with thy wiues in the sight of this Sun.</hi> But letting all the rest passe, which might bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. I will produce one onely example more, and then proceede. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any facte from the beginning of the world, more wicked (if the Instruments be considered) then was the cruell &amp; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death of the son of God, our Lord Iesus Christ. And yet marke what the Holy-Ghost, <hi>Actes</hi> 2, 23. dooth attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto GOD as touching the same. <hi>Him</hi> (sayth S. Peter) <hi>haue yee taken by the hands of the wicked, beeing deliuered by the determinate counsell and fore-knowledge of God: and haue crucified and slaine.</hi> And cha. 4. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> pray after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Doubtlesse against thy holy sonne Iesus, whom thou hadest annointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel gathered them-selues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to doo whatsoeuer thine hande, and thy counsel had before determined to be done.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150910:167"/> In which words, where he saith, that the wicked did whatsoeuer God did forsee and determine before hand; yea &amp; what his hand, that is his power and counsell had before decreed to be done: It is plain that he meaneth a matter of farre greater weight and importaunce, then a simple permission or suffering of it. But nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Doctrine, there are diuers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections. First, that God cannot auoide the iust note of iniustice and partiality in blinding and hardning some more then other, and that he must needs be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their sinne and euill, whom he so blindeth and hardneth. For aunswere wherunto, first we must know that faith, true repentance, and remorse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, zeale of Gods glory, and all other like speciall graces, proceed wholy from God, who is at his liberty, to impart and bestow them as pleaseth him. Although he giue grace and Fayth to neuer so few; and leaue all the rest in neuer so great blindnesse, infidelity, and hardnesse of heart, yet offereth he wrong to no man, seeing it is altogether at his owne choise
<pb facs="tcp:150910:167"/> whether any shalbe partakers of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or no, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 15. out of Exod. 33. <hi>I wil haue mercie on him, to whom I wil shewe mercie, and I wil haue compassion on him, on whom I wil haue compassion.</hi> So that the grace and mercye of God is free, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēding of it is not tied to this man, to this time or place, but all going according to the will of his eternall purpose, as Iohn. 3, 8. <hi>The winde bloweth where it lusteth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tel whence it commeth, and whether it goeth, so is euerie man that is borne of the spirite.</hi> If a mortall man refuse to doo that which lyeth at his owne choyse whether he wil do it or no, he is not to be blamed thogh he do it not: Much lesse then, ought the Lord of heauen and earth to bee accused or found fault withall, in the effecting of his will, seeing (as it is fit) he is at much more liberty, to do ot not to do as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him. So that we must take heed, that we neuer call the will of God into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or disputation, further then himself hath reuealed it in his word, but in feare &amp; trembling euermore submit our selues
<pb facs="tcp:150910:168"/> vnto it, as vnto a will, that willeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is iust and right, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we bee not able to measure and comprehend the highnesse and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his proceedings. We must learn to set more by Gods glorye, then by our owne saluation, and know God to bee a God, that doth vpon the earth, not only mercy and trueth, but also Iustice and iudgment, and so euermore &amp; in all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yeeld to his Maiesty all Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and praise; according as of right it belongeth vnto him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the Lord is sayde to harden, and to giue vp into a reprobat sence; in these two respects is he saide so to do; first, because according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal purpose of his owne wil, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth from the reprobate the gracious regeneration &amp; sanctification of his holy spirit, of the which beeing destitute, it is vtterly vnpossible that they should doo any thing pleasing God, or acceptable in his sight. And the reason is, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commeth to passe without, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his purpose and decree, the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:150910:168"/> in the same his purpose &amp; drecree, neuer declining from his owne nature, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remaining most holy, iust, &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in euery proportion and respect. Neither vnto <hi>Pharao,</hi> nor vnto any other vngodly reprobate, did or doth the Lord at any time giue any wicked commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or euill thought, but those wicked thoughts and euill motions which are in them by nature, &amp; through the instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of satan, as he doth not purge them of them, so doth his wisedome vse them to the glory of his owne name, to the good of his children, &amp; to the vtter confusion of such workers of iniquity; &amp; who dare affirm, that in this kind of dealing, ther is any vnrighteousnes in God at al, or that he is the author of their sin? which he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not into their harts, but being therin already, ordereth, directeth, &amp; desposeth it to a good end. <hi>Thou art not a God</hi> (Ps. 5, 4 5.) <hi>that loueth wickednesse, neither shall euil dwel with thee. The foolish shal not stād in thy sight, thou hatest al them that work iniquity.</hi> The prophet in these words plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that nothing can be more contrarie
<pb facs="tcp:150910:169"/> to the Nature of God then sin &amp; naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse. And for this cause also dooth the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. deriue sinne, death, and damnation from <hi>Adam:</hi> but from God, grace, forgiuenesse and life, through the mediation of Iesus Christ. And in chap. 7. he euidently declareth, that the Lawe <hi>is holy, and the commandement iust &amp; good,</hi> insinuating thereby, that in God, or in his wil, there springeth not any litle spot at all of sinne or vnrighteousnesse. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>If our vnrighteousnesse commend the righteousnesse of God, what shal we say; is God vnrighteous that punisheth? God forbid.</hi> Al these places do plainly conclude, that howsoeuer God hath made the Wicked man for the day of euill; and howsoeuer there is no sinne committed by any of them without his will, yet is hee by no meanes the author of any mans wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but alwayes remayneth most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his wayes, and holy in all his workes, as the Prophet speaketh further. <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. Thus much as touching the generall point: Now more perticulerly, when he saith that <hi>god hath giuen them the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:169"/> spirit of slumber,</hi> it is asmuch as if hee shoulde say, that God hath giuen them vp into a deepe security, so as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine euen sencelesse, and without any true feeling and perseuerance of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere will and waies of the Lord, to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Maiesty in a constant faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience accordingly. After this maner, plainly giuing to vnderstand, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are some so carelesse and secure, and so fast asleepe (as it were) in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and cogitations of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as that they make no reckoning of, neither are any thing at all moued, either with the sweet promises of Gods grace and mercy in Christ Iesus, to bring forth the fruits of true faith and repentance in the whole course of their life, or with the dreadfull threatninges of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to abstaine from doing euill, but lye still, as it were benummed and sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, in a dull and heauy slumber. Again whereas there are some, who although the truth and simplicity of the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ be neuer so plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly layd open before their eyes, and most
<pb facs="tcp:150910:170"/> familiarly applyed to their consciences, and so as they cannot choose but see the way of life &amp; saluation, do yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing remaine still in their Naturall blindnesse, infidelity and prophanenesse, without any effectuall calling, or any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of sanctification. All this comes to passe, thorough the iust and righteous iudgements of God, so depriuing them of his grace, as that they can neither pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be allured to faith and repentance, by the promises of Gods mercy, nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified from vngodlinesse, by the denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his iudgements. What pains so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer bee taken, and what meanes soeuer be vsed, to make them see &amp; vnderstand the wayes and will of the Lord; yet will they remaine in obstinacy and hard-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse against the same. After this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stoode the case and condition of the Iewes; insomuch, that through the iust and righteous iudgment of God, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their proud conceits of their own righteousnesse, and of their Tyrannous cruelty against the Sonne of God, &amp; his faithfull seruants, whereas they thought
<pb facs="tcp:150910:170"/> themselues wise, they became fooles and sencelesse (as the Apostle speaketh of such, <hi>Ro.</hi> 1.) and whereas they perswade themselues clearly to perceiue &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the depth of Gods Mysteries, they approoued themselues vtterly blind and ignorant of the same, without discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or knowing any thing aright, and as they should do. And surely, this as I said was a iust iudgement of God vpon them and vppon their Pride and arrogancie of heart, according as <hi>Iohn</hi> 12, 39, 40. the Euangelist plainly expresseth it, saying; <hi>Therefore could they not beleeue, because that Esayas sayth, he hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, nor vnderstande with their hearts, and should be conuerted, and I should heale them.</hi> And again, ch. 9, 39. this thing declareth also our Lord Iesus Christ, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainely saying; <hi>I am come vnto Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into this world, that they which see not, might see, and that they which see, might bee made blinde.</hi> Speaking there of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who perswaded themselues, that they wer most holy in the sight of god, &amp; that
<pb facs="tcp:150910:171"/> there was nothing hid from their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding. Another feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful example of this maner of Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after this sort punnishing sinne with sin, doth the Apostle also recorde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 26, 28, 29, &amp;c. against the most filthy idolatry and abhominations of the Gentiles. <hi>For this cause</hi> (saith hee) <hi>GOD gaue them vp vnto vile affections.</hi> And a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle afterward, <hi>As they regarded not to know God, euen so God deliuered them vp vnto a Reprobate minde, to do those thinges which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>1</label> are not conuenient, &amp;c.</hi> And heerof is there also sufficient experience from day to day, which ought so much the more of euery one to be duly considered, as they feele the hand of God vpon them, in the same respect, which vndoubtedly vppon due trial and examination may be found to be very heauy. For how carelesse and secure are the greatest part of men and women, at this day; and how soundly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe in the cogitations of worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleasures? And so, as they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moued with any regarde either of Gods mercies or iudgements? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:171"/> how sencelesse, dull, and ignorant in the true knoledge of God, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, and their own saluation tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Iesus Christ? Few, yea verie few there are (the Lorde knoweth) that take any true care, or make conscience of first seeking the kingdome of God and the righteousnesse thereof, that haue anye sound perswasion of the trueth in their hearts, together with a willing desire to walke in obedience accordingly. Al sorts and degrees professe themselues Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, euen as all the Iewes generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted themselues <hi>Israelites;</hi> they will not sticke to come to the Church where the worde of God is preached, but the greatest part (as I sayd) are so bewitched with the cogitations of this vaine and transitory life, and so besotted with the pride and prophanesse of their own harts as that they are nothing at all the better either in knowledge or in obedience, for any thing that hath beene spoken vnto them. It commeth in at one eare (as the saying is) &amp; goeth out at the other, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pierceth so deeply, as to take rooting
<pb facs="tcp:150910:172"/> in their hearts, but they returne home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as blockish and sencelesse, and as farre from true Faith, repentance, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of conscience, and all other good effects (if not much further) as whē they came thether; nay as if nothing woorth the hearing had bin deliuered vnto them For this cause, most notably, <hi>Mathew</hi> 13. doth our Lord Iesus Christ resemble the hearts and mindes of such hearers, vnto the highway, and vnto stony and thorny ground. By the high way, vnderstanding such hearts and mindes as are beaten so hard (as it were) with the trampling of wicked cogitations, and perpetual vse of euill doing, that the word of God when it is preached, cannot possibly enter, but lieth in the top, &amp; swimmeth (as it were) in the eare, where by the Deuils Birds, it is easily deuoured and taken away. Now one of these Birdes, which thus deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the seede of Gods worde, before it can enter into the hearts of such men, is worldly security, which so lulleth men asleepe, in the delights and cogitations of earthly thinges, that they can neither
<pb facs="tcp:150910:172"/> fruitfully heare, eyther the sweete songs of Gods mercifull prouidence, alluring them to Repentaunce, or the dreadfull threatnings of his Iudgements, terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from dooing euill. They are like vnto those, who are taken with the drowsie sickenesse called <hi>Lethargie,</hi> vnto whom, though a man speake or crie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so lowde, yet will they hear nothing nor shew any token that they are aliue; but pricke them with a pinne, and then they will open their eyes, &amp; look sterne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for a while) as if they were angry, but by and by they are fast asleepe agayne, &amp; behaue themselues as if they were dead. So standeth the case (I say) with al those whom God hath couered with the spirit of slumber, and who haue their hearts ouer-whelmed with worldly security. If a man preach vnto them the Worde of God, bee it neuer so effectually, and in neuer so tender a desire of their good &amp; Saluation, it nothing mooueth them: but pricke them a little, and pierce their Consciences vnto the quicke, labour to rowze them vp from their slumbring, by
<pb facs="tcp:150910:173"/> discouering their apparant guiltinesse &amp; prophanenesse. And then for a time it is with them, as with a sleeping Dogge (as the Prouerbe is) that is sodainely awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they will storme and chafe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes take on, as if they were almost out of their wits. But by experience it is found, that this seldom continueth long, the guiltinesse and accusation of their owne Consciences putting them to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and so (as if all were forgotten, or nothing concerned them) they fall vnto their former drowsinesse, and become as sencelesse and carelesse as euer before. But howsoeuer such wicked ones are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thus slumbring and sleeping when there is any question touching gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their owne saluation in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that which is amisse, eyther touching knowledge, or practise; yet is it farre otherwise with them, when there is any matter in hand, concerning the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of their owne will and corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the matters of this life. Let it concerne either their profit or pleasure, and they will neither slumber nor sleepe
<pb facs="tcp:150910:173"/> in the effecting of it. And especially, if they haue conceiued any plot in theyr heads, or resolued vppon any deuise to hinder the course of the Gospel, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or disgrace men in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, or to vex and persecute the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Preachers of it: in such cases as these, you shall neuer see such men (I warrant you) either slumber or sleepe. For the effecting of their will heerein, they will thinke no paines nor coste too much, and not sticke to wake and watch both night and day; and there is good reason for it. For the Diuell (whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and seruants they are) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faithful Preachers and professors of the Gospell, to bee chiefe enemies of his kingdome and gouernment; and that if it were not for such as they are, his sway and dominion would be far greater then it is, among the sonnes &amp; children of men, hee is therefore euermore prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and egging them forward to hurt &amp; disgrace such men, by all possible means. And he must needs go (as the saying is) whom the Deuill driues. Nay marke it
<pb facs="tcp:150910:174"/> who wil) though such be aboue al others most greedily set vpon the World, and care not howe they come by the wealth and Commodities of it, so as eyther by right or wrong, they may possesse it; yet when they haue any thing in hande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods Seruants, they are nothing so dilligent in following of their priuate Commodities, as they are in that. All other thinges are set aside, and slightly regarded, in comparison thereof. If they can boast that they haue contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted such a Sermon, disgraced such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor any way, by their slanderous ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, or otherwise hurte or persecuted the Minister, or brought him to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience or rebuke: Heere is their ioy, heerein they glory and triumph. In this they perswade themselues they doo God good seruice; and no measure will they keepe in their vnreasonable insulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yea, and which is yet more then this, and too well founde by experience, so carefull is the Deuill to keepe such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and that (so long as they are in his seruice) they should neyther slumber nor
<pb facs="tcp:150910:174"/> sleepe, that before they haue ended one proiect, they are resolued vppon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Deuill alwayes furnisheth them with newe matter, and so as they will oftentimes boast and threaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, what they purpose to doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that they will not so giue ouer, but what successe soeuer they haue in one matter, yet will they vppon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, trouble him for this, and bring him into question for that, and so as he shall neuer liue in peace or rest. Thus you see how the case standeth with such whom God hath couered with the spirit of slumber, they are not so dul, slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and sencelesse in matters of godlines and saluation, but they are as watchfull, as nimble and diligent in things vngodly and prophane: they are not so slowe and backeward to do good, but as ready and forward to do hurt; yea surely, if we shal enlarge this somewhat further, great, &amp; most lamentable (God knoweth) is the security and carelesnesse that is among euen all sorts of men. For, if we cry ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to all such as professe the gospel,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:175"/> and tell them, how the Lord most mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously and mercifully (in these latter dayes) hath restored vnto vs the light &amp; preaching of his holy worde, not to the end that we should continue in sin to the defacing of his glory, but that we should take the opportunity whiles it is offered to be builded vp in knowledge, fayth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and all other like graces of Gods spirite, vntill wee become perfect members of Iesus Christ, and enioy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. That our Lord Iesus Christ hath payde the price of our redemption, and deliuered vs from the thraldom and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity of sinne, Sathan, death, &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to the end we should be vnto the same our Redeemer, a people not onely peculiar, but also vnspotted, denying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse and worldly lustes, and liuing soberly, righteously, and godlye in this present world. Although we put men in mind, how by their Baptisme they haue couenanted to forsake the Deuill and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:150910:175"/> the death of Christ, so shoulde they also bee partakers of his resurrection, to the end, that as Christ rose from death, so we shoulde rise from the death of sinne, to the life of righteousnesse. That we are by our profession the Children of light, &amp; therfore shold walk as the children of light, hauing no fellowship with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darkenes, but reproue &amp; oppose our selues against them; that we are Cittizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God, and therefore shoulde settle our affections in heauen, and vpon heauenly things, with a manifest detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatsoeuer in this worlde, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth against the aduauncement of Gods glory in our mortall bodies. That we are none of our own, but bought for a price, and that therfore we should glorify God in our bodies, and in our Spirits, for they are Gods, suffer his will, his worde, and his spirit, to guide and gouerne vs in all things. Although we teach (I say) and deliuer these things neuer so plainly, and vrge them to mens consciences neuer so familiarly, yet so entangled and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
<pb facs="tcp:150910:176"/> are the most part, and so fast asleep as it were, in worldly profits, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures &amp; delights, as that they nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard such wholsom instructions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, to be any thing at all bettred or amended by thē. Nay, thogh we take a contrary course, &amp; sound aloud in their ears, the terrible threatnings of gods ven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geance, &amp; shew vnto men, that their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse in receyuing so great grace &amp; mercy of God in vain, is most intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that continuing (as they do) in such blindnesse, ignorance, &amp; prophanes, contrary to such heauenly doctrines and admonitions as they daily heare, they greeuously prouoke the Lord to anger, although such words might shake stony rocks, &amp; cause them to tremble, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not they moue a great part of those that hear them; they sound in their eares, as if they were pronounced with a stamering tong, &amp; in a strāge language (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks, <hi>Esay.</hi> 28, 11) &amp; becomes vnto them as the words of a book that is sealed vp: they shew no sign of any good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel that hath bin giuen vnto them. But to

We see clearly further by that which hath bin spoken, that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful vnseemly thing, and a very horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and intollerable vnthankfulnesse, for those vnto whom the Lord hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed the cleare light of the glorious gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Iesus Christ, &amp; who haue taken on them the professiō of the same, to wallow securely and licentiously in the wayes of vngodlines, &amp; to follow the lusts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their owne hearts. They that liue in the time of ignorance &amp; blindnes, without faithful teaching and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Gospell (being the ordinary meanes to bring them to the true knowledge of God in Christ Iesus) it is no maruel though the affections of their hearts, and the actions of their liues be very dissolute and prophane, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (notwithstanding the time and places of Ignorance and blindnes wherin they liue) they are vtterly yet without excuse before God; yet assuredly is their estate to be pittyed and lamented. But as for those, vnto whom the Lorde in his
<pb facs="tcp:150910:177"/> tender mercy, hath vouchsafed his holy word to shine vnto them as acleare light in a darke place, and yet as though they perceiued nothing, lye fast asleepe (as it were) in the deepe slumber of sinne and security, bringing foorth the vnsauory fruits of vnrighteousnesse and Infidelity, without remorse of Conscience, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no pleasure nor delight in the waies of the Lord, to glorifye his Maiesty, and to seale the assurance of their own salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accordingly: how much more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full their sinne is, how much more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is their vnthankefulnesse; and howe much more worthily such deserue a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudgement from the Lorde, to their vtter confusion, and that without any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying or lamenting their estate at al, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans Conscience must needes assure him.

Now, if wee lye as men asleepe, and keepe not watch and warde against these enemies of our saluation, praying continually vnto the Lord, for that spirituall armour of God, (whereof speaketh the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6, 16, 17.) that is to say, for the <hi>shield of faith for the Helmet of saluation, and for the sword of the spirit,</hi> whereby we may be able, not onely to resist, but preuaile euen to the vtter quenching <hi>of al the fiery dartes of the wicked.</hi> Surely, we are worthy to be giuen ouer to the miserable bondage and slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them; euen till we haue the reward of sin, which is euerlasting condemnatiō. But the lord knoweth how many soeuer the enimies of our saluation be, how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently soeuer they ly in wait to betray &amp; entrap vs, how fearfull an ingratitude so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, to yeilde to their enticements &amp; temptations, &amp; so consequently, how fearful an effect soeuer wil follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to the confusion of both soule and bodye; yet lamentable is it to consider what little regard is taken of the greatest part, for the resisting &amp; withstanding of them,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:179"/> nay rather, what great pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light many men take, willingly to bee caught and helde captiue in their snares. For the preuenting &amp; resisting of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bodily enemy, that seeketh the hurt of our good name, person, or goods we will be very watchful and prouident, and need not much be put in mind of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse &amp; circumspection, but as for the withstanding of the deadly enemies of our soules, although we be continually warned and put in minde of them, and of their subtleties and deceits in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ministry and preaching of the Gospel, whereby we are also most plainly taught how to escape and auoyd their snares, &amp; to preserue our selues in peace and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet all is in vaine, and to no purpose, as good speake to the stone walles, as to the most part of men and weomen; like the deafe Adder they stop their eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the voyce of the charmer, though he be neuer so expert and skilfull in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Neither is this common allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and excuse to any purpose, but onely to tempt and prouoke the Lorde, when
<pb facs="tcp:150910:179"/> men will say (as it is vsuall to hear many men say, when they are either found falt withal for their ignorance or prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or exhorted to be more zealous &amp; forward in the duties of religion &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse) I am not learned, God doth not giue a like gift to euery one, &amp;c. Some such there are, who perswade thēselues, that by such answers as these, they haue maruailous well excused themselues, &amp; that nothing can further bee added to their reptoofe. Indeed it is true, that God hath not giuen to euery one a like porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and an equall measure of his gifts and graces, but <hi>to some ten Talents, to some fiue, and to some but one,</hi> according to the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Math.</hi> 25, 15. But now, if so bee that they who haue receiued greatest graces and gifts from God, are bound of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and vnder paine of condemnation to encrease their measure, and to multiply their giftes, what then shall become of them, which remaine in such security &amp; carelesnesse, that they wil take no paines by such wholsom and ordinary meanes, as the Lord hath appointed, to grow in
<pb facs="tcp:150910:180"/> grace, and to encrease the small measure which they haue of sounde knowledge, faith, Repentance, zeale of Gods glorie, and the rest? <hi>If the righteous</hi> (saith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist. 4, 38.) <hi>shal scarcely be saued, where shall the vngodly, and the sinner appeare?</hi> If those that haue receiued greatest gifts &amp; graces of sanctification, haue neede, nay must of necessity labour and endeuor to encrease in euery of them: Much more then vndoubtedly doth it stand such vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to labour and endeuour, who haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little or none at al. When any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or opportunity is offred vnto vs for the ataining of any worldly commodity. Wonderfull it is to consider, how ready and diligent men will be about the same, thinking no paines to great, but earely &amp; late, in colde and heate, they will be sure to prouide for the enioying of it, but as for the Heauenly Riches of the kingdom of glorye, in comparison whereof, all earthly thinges are meerely vaine; yea, and vanitie it selfe, although they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto vs to day, and wee knowe not whether we shall haue eyes to see them,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:180"/> and eares to heare them to morrow; nay although our owne Consciences cannot choose but tell vs, that vnlesse we be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in some good measure with these thinges, it is vtterly vnpossible for vs to be saued; yet the least pains, the least cost that is bestowed heereabout, is thought to be too too much: nay though they be freely offered, we regard them not, wee cannot finde in our hearts to spare one day in seauen to this purpose; but a great part euen of that, must, and is ordinarily abused, prophaned, and defiled, by the Cogitations, and by the wordes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our corrupte and vn-reformed hearts; which surely, would not be done in such sort, and so commonly as it is, vnlesse God had couered men with the spirite of slumber. Let vs therefore in the feare of God, take due consideration of these thinges; and seeing it is most cleare and manifest, by that which hath beene spoken; as also, by dailye expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that vnlesse the Spirite of God dwell in our hearts, by the gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Sanctification thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:181"/> we shall not onely be secure and careles, and remaine wonderfull sencelesse in the mysteries of the Lorde, according to his word, voyd of sound knowledge, of true faith, of true repentance; yea, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without all true peace of conscience, all true ioy in the Holy-Ghost, of al true assurance of Gods loue, and of eternall life, but grow and go forward from euill to worse; in Ignoraunce, Infidelity, and hardnesse of heart, in pride and all maner of prophanenesse, euen vntill we run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reprobate sence. That therefore, as we tender the glory of God, &amp; our own saluation, we be duly mindfull to pray &amp; beseech the Lord for the continuall resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his blessed spirite, not onely to expell and vanquish our natural dulnesse and vntowardnesse, all high and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant conceits of our owne Wisedome, knowledge, and vprightnesse; but also to sanctifye vs to a cheerefull and effectuall accomplishment of euery dutie, which God requireth at our hands. Alwayes to this end, and for the obtaining of this grace, zealously &amp; religiously vsing such
<pb facs="tcp:150910:181"/> ordinary meanes as the Lorde hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as Prayer, the hearing of the word of God preached, reading of the holye Scriptures, and such wholesome Doctrines and exhortations as are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the same, as also often Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with such as are able to instruct and confirme vs in the trueth; yea, vntill the word of God dwell in vs plenteously in all wisedom, and spirituall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and wee become able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints, what is the <hi>breadth and length, and depth, and height; and know the loue of Christ, which passeth al Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and so bee filled with all fulnesse which commeth from God.

<pb facs="tcp:150910:183"/> the grace of God, when it was put into their hands. With that Text, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. the Iewes do arme themselues euen vnto this day, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon take great occasion to boast of thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. It is sayd of vs (say they) that wee bee men of vnderstanding, a people of great wisedome, of passing Nobility &amp; worthines, this is true. Thus indeed was it sayde of them in times past, and thus great should their honour haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vntill nowe, if they had helde fast the treasure which God gaue them, and had kept it well. But seeing they bee fleeted away from the Lord, and haue a vail cast ouer their hearts, as the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 15. seeing from time to time they disobeyed the Prophets, reiected Christ Iesus, and becam hardned against the Doctrine of saluation; they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily now becom as blind and ignorant, if not more blinde and ignorant then the very Heathen. For needs must they (who haue heard the voice of God, and refused to obey) be stricken with the spirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinesse, and be carryed away of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:184"/> they not offending of simple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as the heathen do, but of a wilfull rage, which is most desperat and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For this cause doth the Prophet, <hi>Esay</hi> 42. thus vpbraid them, saying, <hi>Heare ye deafe, and yee blind regard that ye may see.</hi> And why speaketh he to the deaf &amp; blind to hear and see? he addeth the reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had seen and herd inough, but regarded it not. We may see also in that place, how the Lord complaineth of the labor which he lost, in teaching his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how he had done works enow amōg them, but they had neither eies to see, nor eares to heare, but in blindnes passed al the heathen and vnbeleeuers, they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shutting their eies, and hardening their harts, that they might not perceiue nor vnderstand. This may further be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by other examples. If wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what maner of men <hi>Iobs</hi> frends were, which talked with him in the time of his affliction, it appeareth plainly by the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they were excellent men, and of experience, no fooles, but of great wit, &amp; yet for al that doth he say of them, ch. 17
<pb facs="tcp:150910:184"/>
               <hi>that God had hid their heart from vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> The Philosophers among the mē of <hi>Athens,</hi> were famous for their wisedome and knoledge throughout the world, and surely very wise they wer indeed, for the discerning and vnderstanding of naturall things, yea and so as few in any age since haue attained vnto the like, and yet as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> found by experience, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. and as he speaketh expresly of them, <hi>Ro.</hi> 1. because they disdained to containe thēselues within the bounds of that wise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome and knowledge which God by his creatures had reuealed to them, but wold needes bee climbing higher: when they thought themselues wise, they became fools. <hi>Salomon</hi> (as we read, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 4, 29, 30) <hi>had wisedome &amp; vnderstanding exceeding much, &amp; a large hart, euen as the sand that is on the sea shore, his wisedom excelled the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of al the children of the East, and all the wisedome of Egipt, for he was wiser then any man,</hi> but yet wanting the continuall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods word, hee was at length, (notwithstanding his aboundant wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) carried headlong into extreame
<pb facs="tcp:150910:185"/> folly, yea to the very sinne of Idolatrie, which is of al others most lothsome and odious in the sight of god. <hi>Paul</hi> was a wise man before the time of his calling, yea, not only wise, according to the wisedom of this world; but after a sort verie zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and religious, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>If any man thinke that hee hath whereof hee might trust in the flesh: much more I, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised the eight day, of the Kinred of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, of the Tribe of Beniamin, an Ebrew of the Ebrewes, by the law a Pharisee. Concerning zeale, I persecuted the Church of Christ, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the righteousnesse which is in the lawe, I was vnrebukeable.</hi> But after he was once conuerted to the Faith of the Gospell, then marke what hee presently addeth. <hi>But the things which wer vantage vnto me, the same I counted losse for Christs sake; yea, doubtlesse I thinke al things but losse, for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lorde, for whom I haue counted all thinges losse, and doo iudge them to bee dung, that I might win Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Many men most worthily famous for wisedome and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding there are at this day; yea and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:185"/> so, as fewe ages in former time haue had experience of the like, but yet the wisest of them al, without the direction of gods word, is but a very foole, and may learne by the worde of God to bee much more wise. Al the wisedome of the worlde, in comparison of the Wisedome of Gods word, being vtterly vaine, and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any account at all. And therefore notably, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24. <hi>It is written</hi> (saieth S. Paule) <hi>I will destroy the wisedome of the wise, and will cast away the vnderstanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter of this world? Hath not God made the wisedome of this worlde foolishnesse?</hi> And a little after, <hi>the Iewes require a signe, &amp; the Grecians seeke after wisedome. But we preach Christ crucified vnto the Iewes euen a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, and vnto the Grecians foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: But vnto them which are called both of the Iewes and Grecians: we preach Christ the power of God, and the wisedome of God.</hi> The Apostle in these words manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that all the Wisedome of this world, is but meere vanity and foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:186"/> if it be not beautifyed and adorned with the wisedome of Gods spirit; &amp; if it haue not the word of God, a continual directer of the same. Many more Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and examples might be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, for the further enlarging of this point, but by these you may see, what blindnesse of minde is; yea a much more wretched and miserable blindnesse, then outward and bodily blindnesse, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as it doth) through the neglect or contempt of the light of Gods truth, it is a greeuous sinne wherewith God dooth punnish the wicked, and which maketh them guilty of eternall death. And now let vs proceed to make some vse of that which hath been spoken. First, seeing the <hi>Iewes</hi> are thus blamed by the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> as we haue heard out of chapter 42. notwithstanding <hi>Moses</hi> before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. had recorded them to bee a wise people, and of great vnderstanding, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing the Scribes &amp; Pharisies, beeing the cheefest and learnedst among all the rest, were of such blind minds, as Christ also, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9, 41. discouereth them to be, let
<pb facs="tcp:150910:186"/> vs come to our selues, &amp; consider, that if this hapned to the naturall braunches (as the Apostle calleth them in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:) what then may becom of the wild braunches that are but grafted in? It is certain that the Iewes went before vs in preheminence, and had the Birthright in Gods church, beeing the first beleeuers. And which more is, at such time as wee were strangers vnto God, they were of his house and family. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they are more woorthily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of greater blindnes then the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>then, that had neuer any tast of the truth, nor any spark of sound knowledg: and if they be thus condemnd, what shalbe said of vs, vnto whō al things are now much more excellent? For in the gospel which is now preached, the face of god shineth in such wise, through Iesus christ (who is the liuely image of God his father) that we may discern him aswell, as if he were dwelling amongst vs. And nowe, if wee haue not our eies open to receiue his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, &amp; be not diligent to profit therein, must not <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
               </hi> vengeance the prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:150910:187"/> of, worthily light vpon our heades, that we shall bee made more blinde and brutish then the very Heathen? Because hearing we would not heare, and seeing, we wold not see? And surely, how right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this iudgement is already executed, it is most lamentable to consider. Look vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iewes and Turkes, and they bear some reuerence to their Religion, and so do the Papists too; and yet are al of them through their owne fault, cut off from the Church of God, though surely (if we seriously consider, how much more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the light shineth amongst vs, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) neither of them so much too blame as we. For doo not manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, knowe and professe one thing, and practise the cleane contrary? and are growne to such a sencelesnesse of mind, that they haue no remorse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for any thing at all? But I will let this passe, and come to a second Vse, we being also taught from hence, that as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:150910:187"/> among the Iewes, were not onely men of great countenance and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but men also of great learning and knowledge, and yet we see by conference of this text, with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. and other places, what blinde guides they were, and how maruailous ignoraunt and sencelesse in the Mysteries of saluation. So that wee must not take it for a generall rule, that euery one that is in high place of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, must needes also be a man of deepe wisedome and knowledge. And that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is a great Schollar, &amp; hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken degrees in the Vniuersity, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Doctor, or a great Prelate in the world, that euery such one (I say) is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all question, a sound and a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and so as euerie thing is absolutely to be beleeued and resolued vpon, which they shall teach, enioyne, or commaund. For God can blindfold such as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and in all wisedome, knowledge, and vnderstanding, and in all the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying giftes and graces of Gods Spirite, make very simple, base, and vnlearned men, very highly to excel and go beyond
<pb facs="tcp:150910:188"/> them, according to that of our Lorde Iesus Christ, Luke 10, 21. <hi>That same houre</hi> (sayth the Euangelist) <hi>reioyced Iesus in the spirit and saide, I confesse vnto thee Father, Lord of heauen and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and learned, and hast reuealed them to Babes; euen so Father, because it so pleased thee.</hi> And 1. Cor. 1. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>you see your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, how that not many wisemē after the flesh not many mighty, not many Noble are called: But God hath chosen the foolish thinges of the world, to confound the wise, &amp; God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the weake things of the world, to confound the mighty thinges, and vile thinges of the worlde, and thinges which are despised hath god chosen to bring to nought things that are, that no flesh shuld reioyce in his presence.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording also as besides the consideration and example of the blinde man, of whom we read, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. by the answers which he made, so confounding the Pharisies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time the great <hi>Rabines</hi> of the world, as that they knew not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, nor what to contradict, but from wicked words were faine to turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="tcp:150910:188"/> to cruell deedes; this may further appeare by sundry other authorities. The very Apostles of Christ, before the time of their calling, were but silly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men for the greater part; and after their vocation, as well in the time of Christ, as after his assention, of very smal estimation and account in the world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they were esteemed but euen as it were, the off-skouring of al things: and yet, what great &amp; notable things, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord to effect &amp; bring to passe by their ministry, the history of the scripture doth most notably declare. The Lord in heauēly wisedom thus mightily working by weak means, that it might apear, that the gifts and graces of his spirit, are not tied either to the persons of men, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means that can be vsed. God ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I deny not) giueth his gifts and graces by means, but they are not tied I say, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mens persons, nor to mens places nor to any means. But the lord God oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without all respect of these things, that himselfe may haue the whol glory,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:189"/> confoundeth the learned by the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the wise by the foolish, the strong by the weak, according as besides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples already alledged, what notable experiences there were heereof, in the Martyrs of Christ, in the daies of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> how wonderfully the gret Bishops the Doctors, add Learned men, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes confounded and put to the foil by meruailous seely men to looke vpon, and who were altogether vnlearned; &amp; not onely by vnlearned men, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also euen hy simple and seely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It is surely verie admirable to see and consider in the Ecclesiasticall history written of them. Furthermore, from <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> hence ariseth a very profitable lesson for all such as take pride in their owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and presume vppon their owne sharpe wit, skill, and pollicy, that in the feare of God, such learn heereby to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues, knowing that God in a moment can vtterly bereaue them of all sence; and if in the matters of this life, (as oftentimes it commeth to passe. None found more fooles, then such as wil brag
<pb facs="tcp:150910:189"/> most of their craft and subtlety, nor any verier Cowards, then such as most boast of their strength and man-hood:) howe much more then in matters of Religion, &amp; of the secrets of Gods kingdom, which are contrary to naturall reason, &amp; which cannot bee knowne without the speciall illumination of Gods spirite? It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a great offence to simple and ignoraunt men, and a great stumbling-blocke in their way, to see so great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of iudgement among the learned, and to heare them so confidently affirme contrary things. How shall we doo (say they) and what shall wee resolue vppon, when those that are of so great knoledge and vnderstanding, do agree no better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues? Many great Learned men there are among the papists, and yet almost in all fundamentall points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, differ from the Protestants. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also doo the learned Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one. For what a pittifull breach, (say they) is there among vs at this day? And what a lamentable rent hath it alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made? Many congregations depriued
<pb facs="tcp:150910:190"/> of their painfull Pastors, and wandering as Sheepe vpon the Mountaines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Shepheard? Indeed, these disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vnhappy contentious, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preiudiciall and hurtfull (I confesse) to all such as obserue them, and cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and iudge aright. But to remooue this stumbling block aswell as I can. First we must know, that it is no newe thing to see contentions and disagreements in the Church. It hath alwayes bin so from the beginning, as in S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Victor</hi> and <hi>Iraeneus, Polycrates</hi> and <hi>Auice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and the Lord in his heauenly Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prouidence doth see it fit, that it should so continue, that such as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued may be knowne. But howsoeuer the case standeth betwixt the papistes &amp; vs, of which I haue often spoken heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet surely, the contentious among our selues, seeing we al agree in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of religion, &amp; differ in no material or fundamentall point, are not so great, as should either make any seperation, or enforce any such breach or rent amongst vs, if those in Authority be pleased so to
<pb facs="tcp:150910:190"/> iudge and esteeme of the perticulers in controuersie, and (according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of indifferent things) to leaue them to a free and an indifferent vse. As those differences ought not (as I said) to make any breach, separation, or rent; so doo not I holde them of sufficient force, to make any man stagger in the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, seeing we all agree therein; and there is (the Lord bee praised) no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all in that behalfe. And for the shutting vp of this point, let euerie one know, that all the wisedome of God, is foolishnesse to mans reason, &amp; therefore not to bee meruelled at, though men of great learning, wisedome, &amp; knowledge, as touching the world, be yet blinde and farre to seeke in heauenly things, vntill it shall please God to enlighten their eyes by his blessed spirit. And that therefore, we euermore tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:150910:191"/> The word of God (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it) is a sure word, wherunto if we take good heed, as vnto a light that shineth in a dark place, we shal neuer do amisse, neither in matters of religion, nor of this life; but being not guided nor directed thereby, not hauing that for a Lanthorne to our paths, and for a light to our steppes, it is vnpossible to do any thing in the whole course of our life, that is pleasing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God, although there bee nothing but darkenesse in the world, yet if wee follow the Doctrine of Gods worde, and haue the ioynt illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Gods spirit, we shall bee well guided: Whereas contrary-wise, if lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the word of God, wee trust to our owne wit, or depend vppon men; say as they say, onely vpon a conceite that wee haue of their learning, wisedome, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or godlinesse. without due trial and examination, whether it bee well or ill: God will not exalte vs (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh,) but at length forsake vs, giue vs vppe to strong delusions, that we should beleeue lyes, as the Apostle speaketh, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2, 11
<pb facs="tcp:150910:191"/> 12. that so in the end we might bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily damned.

Next, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>4</label> we learne from this Doctrine, and it is verie apparant, that vntil such time, as it pleaseth the Lord God in mercy and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnesse to open the eies of men that they may see, to open their ears that they may heare; and therewithal to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and prepare their hearts, that they may receiue instruction, and yeelde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It is vnpossible that they should either know him aright, beleeue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, see their sinnes and transgressions,

If it be demanded why the Lord openeth the eyes, and sanctifieth the hearts of some to faith and obedience, and not of all; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth grace to some for the glorifying of God in their mortall bodies, and for the sure sealing of their own saluation in the fruits of repentance and newnesse of life, and suffereth others to remaine in the blindnesse, ignorance, &amp; hardnes of their owne hearts, without any effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at any time: Wee must know &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand for a full and sufficient answere heereunto, not only that all these graces I haue spoken of are the gifts of god, who being endebted to no man, remaines at his free choise, whether any shall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them or no; but also, that they are proper and peculiar only vnto Gods children, and neuer bestowed by the lord vpon any other. Vnto them alone, it is
<pb facs="tcp:150910:192"/> giuen (I say) to know god aright, to haue true faith in his promises, to be touched with true Repentance &amp; remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in regard of their sinnes, to haue true zeale of Gods glory, peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, ioy in the Holy-Ghost through the assurance of Gods loue, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. But as for al those that are not elected nor sanctifyed from aboue, how far they continue for euer, without the enioying of any of these, what means so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer be vsed, for the planting of them in their hearts, wee haue made it so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest heeretofore in the examples of <hi>Kain, Pharaoh, Esau, Iudas,</hi> and of the Scribes and Pharisees, as that I neede not stand now any longer vpon it.</p>
            <p>Last of all, we may learn and obserue <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>5</label> from hence, that there is no greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery or wretchednesse, then when men are ignorant and sencelesse of their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and do not see or discerne the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched estate and condition wherein they stand.

And lastly, who although in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of all these thinges, as also of their scoffing, vnchast behauiour, rayling, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy talking, backe-byting, and such like, they be euidently discouered and conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the iudgement of all men that can discern, that they are but prophane men, vtterly voide of sanctification, (without which no man shall see the Lorde:) yet wretched and miserable men as they are, they either cannot, or will not see, and

No, no, you your selfe, or such and such are blinde and ignorant; you your selfe are proud and enuious, and malicious, &amp; contentious: It is you that oppresse, that will lye, dissemble, that vse to scoffe, &amp;c. wee for our parts being free, &amp; without fault, in each respect. Thus, are manie at this day, as ignorant of their miseries, &amp; as sencelesse in their sinnes, as euer were the Iewes, or any other that may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.

<pb facs="tcp:150910:197"/> blindnesse (as surely it is) what then shall be said of those, who yet in an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er measure, like the proud Pharisees, as though neither the Ministers of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, nor any other (howe long soeuer they haue bin trained vp in the Schoole of Christ) were able to see and discerne halfe so clearely as them selues, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Patronizers and Iustifiers of many of these great and greeuous enormities, that haue beene spoken? And will take vpon them to maintaine (and that with warrant too from Gods worde, as they idly pretend) that malice is not malice; enuy no enuy, scoffing no prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Oppression, honest dealing; and so foorth touching diuers other? And that although some men (whom they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affect) bee most apparantly guilty in these, and euery of these, yet for all this, they are honest men, good Christians, and no difference to bee put betwixte them and others; but that they are in as good estate before God, as the best. Is it not a lamentable and pittifull thing, to see men that professe the Gospell, and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:197"/> take themselues to bee grounded Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in it, to bee thus blinde? But beeing thus blinde, it is maruell that they do not in plaine and expresse tearmes, call euill good, and good euill. For in defending malice (as they do) to be no malice, scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, to bee without prophanenesse, and oppression to bee honest dealing: and in maintaining, that such as make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon custome of vaine swearing, lying, filthy talking, contending, mocking, back-biting, &amp;c. to bee honest men and good Christians, it is asmuch in truth &amp; indeed, as if in plain and expresse termes they shoulde thus speake, as one day (if they continue thus halting) they shall be sure to finde and feele. The Vanitie of such mens pretences I shall haue more fit occasion to consider another time; In the meane season, (howe cleare-sighted soeuer they be in their owne conceits, &amp; of how much sounder iudgement to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne) yet if this be not, to condemn the righteous, and to iustify the wicked for a reward, which worthily deserueth a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curse from God: If this be not indeed
<pb facs="tcp:150910:198"/> to send Atheists to Heauen, and honest men to hell (as some heere among vs vse to speak:) if God hath not couered such men with the Spirit of slumber, and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their eyes with a double miste of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and error. Surely, I am so much deceiued, that I dare not say of my selfe, that I do see; no not the truth of any prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciple whatsoeuer. But the contrary being manifest, I praise God, and so praying, that it would please him in like maner to open the eyes of such. If I should not be ouer long, I might heer run further into a large discourse, &amp; yet neuer sufficiently discouer the corruptions that are among men, nay amongst our selues, and which heereby become so much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and incureable, because like the blind Iewes, we either do not, or wil not see and consider how it is with vs: but stil make our selues beleeue, that all is well. In which security and proud conceits, so long as we remaine, it is vnpossible that we should profit by the Doctrin of gods worde, either for the encrease of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or of Faith, or of Repentance, or
<pb facs="tcp:150910:198"/> of any other sanctifying grace of Gods spirit, without the which, there is no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. No meruel is it also, thogh there be so great diuersity in opinions, such ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stinate maintaining of vnlawfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted resolutions, though men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect all admonitions and exhortations that are made vnto them from day to day to mooue them to amendement, and so obstinately remaine and goe on in their peruerse affections &amp; vngodly purposes. For so long as men are puffed vppe with such proud conceits of their owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, knowledge, and sufficiency, as if all other were blinde and coulde not see, and as if in comparison of that which they say and resolue vpon, al other mens sayings and doings to the contrary, were but foolish and vaine. What other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects can be expected or hoped for? But seeing (this being the Wisedome of the world) the end thereof tendeth to death (as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 6.) It behooueth vs in the feare of God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and take heed of it; and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to pray &amp; beseech the Lord to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
<pb facs="tcp:150910:199"/> vs the gracious assistance of his holy Spirit, that laying aside al opinion of our owne wisedome, wee may esteeme and account our selues wise and prudent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to see clearly, and rightly to discerne and iudge onely so farre foorth, and no further then our hearts and mindes are lightned and illuminated by Gods spirit, and so as wee may our selues wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon God, and cause others also to do the same. For this alone, is true wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as <hi>Hosea</hi> sheweth, chap. 14. and so consequently be neuer so froward or wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful, either in our Opinions, or in our life, but that wee may bee willing to submit our selues, our iudgements, and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to bee reprooued, corrected, and reformed by the authority of gods word, from whose mouth soeuer the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth; yea, although from such as in worldly respects, seeme much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise and more simple then our selues. For this, I say againe, is truely to be wise indeede. And therefore, most notably sayth <hi>Salomon,</hi> not onely <hi>Prou.</hi> 25, 12. that reproofe and admonition to a wiseman,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:199"/> is <hi>As a Golden earing, and as an Ornament of fine Gold,</hi> wherein he will take pleasure and delight; but also, chap. 9. that he wil settle himself to be reformed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Giue admonition to the wise,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>and hee wil bee the wiser; teach a righteous man, and he wil encrease in learning.</hi> It bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the contrary, the property of a foolish scorner, to hate him that rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him. And therefore againe in the same Chapter 9. <hi>Rebuke not a scorner least he hate thee; but rebuke a wise man, and hee wil loue thee.</hi> And ch. 15, 12. <hi>The scorner lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not him that rebuketh him, neither will he go to the wise.</hi> And this may suffice for this time.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150910:200"/> deliuered vnto them, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their harts against the faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the same. It comming to passe through the iust iudgment of God, that they who thus refuse the loue of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, being offered vnto them in a tender regard of their saluation, should bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to the beleeuing of errours and lies as a sure seale of their iust condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This consideration you see heere naturally &amp; necessarily arising from this Text. And thus stood the case with the Iewes, and heereof in them haue wee a fearefull example. What a tender care our Lord Iesus Christ had of their good and saluation; how diligently he trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (to this end) from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preaching in all their Cities &amp; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, teaching them the right way to the kingdome of God, and exhorting them to Faith and Repentance, that they might be saued, the History of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell dooth plentifully declare. But what small fruit ensued thereupon; how obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately they hardned themselues against his Doctrine and exhortations, and not
<pb facs="tcp:150910:201"/> onely continued, but euen encreased in vngodlinesse and vnbeleefe, it is grieuous &amp; lamentable to consider. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Text (conferred with other places) doth shew it most plainly, that they wer not simply vnbeleeuers, but malicious vnbeleeuers, wilfully &amp; maliciously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and hard-harted against the truth. Not therefore refusing it, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the trueth, but therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting it, because it was the trueth, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 45. <hi>Because I tel ye the trueth,</hi> sayth Christ, <hi>ye beleeue me not.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, how readye they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and giue credite to the lies and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of false Prophets, and dissembling Hyppocrites, our Lorde Iesus Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 4, 3. plainly expresseth in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which he had with them, saying; <hi>I am come in my Fathers Name, and yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me not; If another shal come in his own Name, him will ye receiue.</hi> As if he sayd, his Doctrine will yee readily beleeue, hee shall bee kindly entertained at your handes. According as howe true this was by former experience, <hi>Gamaliel</hi> Acts
<pb facs="tcp:150910:201"/> 5, 36, 37. dooth plainely declare, in the example of one <hi>Theudas, who rose vppe,</hi> as hee sayeth, <hi>boasting himselfe; to whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted a number of men about foure hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And after him, one Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the Tribute, who in like manner drew away much people after him.</hi> Likewise afterward, as our Lord Iesus Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde, <hi>Mathew</hi> 24, 24. <hi>That there should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise false Christes, and false Prophets, who should deceiue many:</hi> euen so, how truely this was verifyed in the Apostles time, in the example of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, <hi>Actes</hi> 8, 9, 10. where it is recorded, that hee hadde so bewitched the people of <hi>Samaria,</hi> saying; <hi>That hee himselfe was some great man, that they gaue heede vnto him, from the least to the greatest, saying; That he was the great power of God.</hi> Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at any time, expressed they such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, eyther of Christ, or of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, although the Doctrine of <hi>Symon,</hi> and of the other two, directly tended to their destruction: Whereas the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, and of his Apostles, most notably tended to life &amp; saluation.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:202"/> And now, as thus stoode the case with the Iewes in the time of Christ, &amp; of his Apostles, euen so also from time to time before in the daies of the prophets. How zealous and dilligent the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> was in teaching and instructing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his time, the whole course of his prophesy doth plainly declare. But how few notwithstanding were profited by him to faith &amp; obedience; his complaine chap. 53. saying; <hi>Who wil beleeue our report, and to whom is the arme of the Lorde reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</hi>) doth shew it most clearly. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, or no better successe had the rest of the Prophets, according as wee may see further, in the seauenth and eleauenth Chapters of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.

Many other authorities might be produced, but by these we may see, howe much more ready the people haue beene from time to time, to giue eare vnto lying and false Prophets, &amp; to conforme themselues accordingly, then to beleeue and embrace the wholesome Doctrines of the word of God, preached by those whom he hath sent to that end, and to yeelde obedience vnto the same. And now, that heereunto they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily giuen ouer, through the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of god, for the punishment of their pride, and hardnesse of heart, besides the

And the very like example was there again in <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> for preferring the errors and lies of the false Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word of the Lord, in the mouth of the holy Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily also succeeded to his confusion. And now, as through the iust and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgement of God, it commeth to passe, that they which beleeue not the truth, should beleeue and giue credite to errours and false Doctrines, to their iust condemnation; euen so in like manner, through the very same iust &amp; righteous
<pb facs="tcp:150910:203"/> iudgment it commeth to passe, that they who obstinately refuse the holy practise and obedience of the truth, for the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God, in the fruits of the spirit, &amp; in a godlye conuersation accordingly, should likewise be giuen ouer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of sinne and vncleannesse, and so as they should wallowe from one iniquitie vnto another, vntil the ful measure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be heaped vp together, for their iust condemnation.

<pb facs="tcp:150910:205"/> knowledge &amp; faith, and in an holy &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obedience acordingly. Thus much generaly. Now more perticulerly we are <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> further taught from hence, that it is not a simple, and bare hearing of the word of God, with the outward eares, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a mans estate, hapy &amp; blessed before God, vnlesse withall, through the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural &amp; sanctifying grace of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it take sound rooting in the heart, for the establishing of true faith, and for the glorifying of God in the fruits &amp; effects of an holy cōuersation accordingly. This you may see to bee heere also manifestly taught. These wicked ones (of whom the Apostle heere speaketh) with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eares, did, and could heare well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but not hearing to sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, repentance, &amp; saluation, they are rightly saide not to heare at all. And this doth our Lord Iesus Christ expresly confirm, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 25. when he saith in plain termes, that the hearers of his voice shal liue. Not speaking of euery one that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his word with the outwarde eares, but of such, who together with their
<pb facs="tcp:150910:206"/> outward hearing, do inwardly embrace and entertaine it in their hearts. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are outward hearers of Gods worde, and haue the sounding voice thereof in their eares, and yet liue not in that sence Christ there speaketh, but remain neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse most woonderfull prophane in their behauiour, secure and sencelesse in their sins. It is not an outwarde hearing of the worde of God then simply, and by it selfe, that is the power of God to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is effectuall to our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sanctification, to the establishing of faith, and sealing of our saluation; but the inward receiuing and embracing, it is that must bring peace to our souls in this behalfe. According as this is yet further confirmed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 47. by the distinction which our Lorde Iesus Christ there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth betwixt the elect and the reprobate in this behalfe, saying; <hi>Hee that is of Gods word, heareth Gods words; ye therefore heare them not, because yee are not of God.</hi> Not speaking simply there, of hearing, or not hearing with the outwarde eares, for so the Iewes oftentimes heard the worde of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:206"/> God, aswell from Christs owne mouth, as otherwise, and so do many wicked and vngodly reprobates oftentimes hear the word of God at this day: but he speaketh of a religious hearing (as I noted before) whereby commeth sounde knowledge, faith, with the other sanctifying graces of Gods spirit (and which maner of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is proper onely to Gods children) &amp; not of an irreligious hearing, which is proper to the wicked, and which tendeth neither to sounde knowledge, nor true Faith, but to the further hardning of the hart, to the making of them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, &amp; so consequently to the sure sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their iust condemnation. So great difference is there betwixt the elect and the reprobate in the hearing of Gods word. And for this reason, as our Lorde Iesus Christ most notably, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 20, 21 22. resembleth the hearts and mindes of such vnprofitable hearers, vnto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whereof I haue spoken heeretofore; so also vnto stony and thorny grounde: For as stony ground, mingled with som earth, is commonly hot, and causeth the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:207"/> seed, that falleth therin, hastily to sprout foorth, when as yet by reason of the stones the corn cannot possibly be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, &amp; therefore in the heat of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer both blade and root, do quickly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; fade away, euen so, some there are at this day, who oftentimes vpon sodain motions, wil be meruailous hot and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in the question of reformation, &amp; take on for a time as though none wer halfe so zealous of Gods glorie as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, boasting how bolde and resolute they would be, and how plain and direct in the discouery &amp; reproof of that which they iudge to be amisse, yea &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fearing the face or authoritie of any man; if they should be called into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and put to the trial, yea &amp; how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would reioice in such troubles, &amp; esteeme them as their glorye, and as an honor and crown vnto them: whereas it is ordinarily founde by experience, that such hot passions are ofttimes as quickly cooled, and in the time of any trial, none commonly found verier Cowards, then such proud and arrogant presumers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:150910:207"/> their owne strength, euen in matters of more value, worth, and necessity. For <hi>God</hi> (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh) <hi>resisteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> Many there are also, who when they heare the Doctrine of Gods free grace and mercie in Christ Iesus, freely pardoning &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing sinne, and when they heare super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition in fasting, in prayer, and such like things to be reproued, &amp; men exhorted to Christian liberty, they embrace this Doctrine very greedily, and all because they thinke vnder pretence of Christian liberty, to shake off the yoke of discipline and obedience to christian exercises, and to vse the cloke of Gods mercy to couer a loose and licentious life; studying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the meane time, but how to vse the countenance of the gospell, to get ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honor, worldly friendship and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. But no sooner any storm of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or heat of persecution beginneth to arise, whereof they must bee partakers if they wil be constant in the truth.

Such hearers of the word of God were manie of the Iewes; for dreaming that Christ should come like an earthly Prince, that should conquer nations, and make them Lords of the worlde, they at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flocked vnto him in great number, and shewed such liking of him, and of his Doctrine, that the Pharisees and High-Priests were afraid to deale with him, as otherwise they would haue doone. But afterward, when they saw their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions disappointed, and behelde how hee was taken, and in his enemies hands, then could they cry, <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> aswell as the rest, and were well content that <hi>Barrabas</hi> should be let go, and Christ put to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
<pb facs="tcp:150910:210"/> and cruell death. The third kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ground, whereunto our Lorde Iesus Christ resembleth the hearts and minds of such vnprofitable hearers, is the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bushy ground: whereby he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth such, whose affections are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the greedy desires of riches and worldly pleasures. And surely, verie aptly are riches and worldly pleasures resembled to thorns. For as thorns haue faire greene leaues, and beautifull blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes that may allure a man to reach at them; so if he hastily take holde of them, he may be sure to be pricked by them. So there seemeth a certain beauty &amp; sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be in riches, thereby to purchase worldly pompe and pleasures, but if a man with greedinesse set his heart vppon them, they will so wounde him in euerie part, that without repentaunce, they kill him for euer. For they wound not onely in getting, but also in keeping, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, yea and so, as surely there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that dooth so possesse the heart of man, nor so mightily pul it from God &amp; the care of our saluation, as these things
<pb facs="tcp:150910:211"/> do. Not without great cause therefore, doth our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 6, 19, 25, 26. thus exhort, saying; <hi>Lay not vppe treasures for your selues vpon the earth, wher the Moth and Canker corrupte, and where Theeues digge through and steale, but lay vp treasures for your selues in heauen.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Bee not careful for your life, what yee shal eate, or what ye shal drinke, &amp;c. but seek ye first the kingdome of God, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and al these things shal be ministred vnto you.</hi> Heerunto appertaineth that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the Apostle. 1 Tim. 6, 9. <hi>They that wil be rich, fal into tentations and snares, &amp; into many foolish and noisome lustes, which drowne men in perdition and destruction; for the desire of money is the root of al euil, which while some lusted after, they erred from the Faith, and pierced themselues thorough with many sorrowes.</hi> Let vs heerewithall also consider how <hi>Salomon</hi> (who aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had good trial of these earthly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) how he (I say) describeth the vanity of them. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2, 4, 5. where he saith, that he had builded houses, planted <hi>vineyards, gotten seruants and maids, had children born
<pb facs="tcp:150910:211"/> in his house, that hee had great possessions of Beeues and Sheepe, aboue al that were before him in Hierusalem, that he had gathered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him Siluer and Golde, and the cheefe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Kings and Prouinces, &amp;c.</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the rehearsall of these and such like things, it followeth. <hi>Then I looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on al my works that mine hands had wrought, and on the trauaile that I had laboured to do: and beholde, al is vanity and vexation of the spirite, and there is no profite vnder the sun.</hi> This is <hi>Salomon</hi> his iudgement, that all things vnder the Sunne are vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. <hi>Al flesh is grasse</hi> (sayth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esay, also chapt. 40, 6, 7, 8.) <hi>and al the grace thereof is as the Flower of the field, the grasse withereth, and the flower fadeth, &amp;c. but the word of our God shal stand for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</hi> Wherby we are taught that as mans life it selfe, is vaine and transitory; so are all those thinges, wherein it gloryeth and taketh delight; <hi>Honour, Dignity, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Friendship, Health, Strength, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and such like, all which may bee had and lost in an houre. And therefore, a great vanity of vanities it is, for these so
<pb facs="tcp:150910:212"/> vaine, fraile, and vncertaine thinges, to neglect the aduancement of Gods glory in our mortal bodies, and the inestimable treasures of his heauenly kingdome. For this cause, most notably thus exhorteth S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his first chap. saying, <hi>Receiue with meeknesse the worde that is graffed in you, which is able to saue your soules.</hi> Plainly teaching in that phrase of speech, that to the end men may effectualy profit by the hearing of Gods worde, and that it may be vnto them a worde of saluation, they must be religiously carefull to heare and receiue it with meeknesse. They must come and resort to the preaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with minds meekly affected, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and tractable to all duties. The Lord God, who is most high and holye, most graciously promising to be present with all such as are meek and humble minded, and to giue them grace to reuiue theyr spirits, and to giue them life to guide &amp; direct them, and to teach them his way, as Psal. 25, 9. <hi>Them that bee meeke will hee guide in iudgement, and teach the humble his way.</hi> And Esay 57, 15, <hi>I dwel</hi> (sayeth the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:212"/> Lord) <hi>in the high and holy place: with him also that is of an humble and contrite spirite, to reuiue the spirit of the humble, and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart.</hi> And Chap. 66, 2, 5. <hi>to him wil I look, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite spirit, &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at my words.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Heare ye the word of the Lord, al ye that tremble at his word;</hi> which plainly importeth, that whosoeuer do not tremble at gods word whosoeuer in meeknesse of spirite and humblenesse of heart, submit not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereunto, for their instruction, reformation, and continuall direction in the whol course of their life, al such are vnmeet to heare the word of God; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the Doctrines and sweet promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Gods grace and mercy in christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus contained therein, appertaine vnto them. For this cause, most notable lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly vnto this meeknesse of spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rare examples of the same in him-selfe, exhorteth our Lorde Iesus Christ <hi>Math.</hi> 11, 29. saying, <hi>Learne of me, that I am meeke and lowly in heart; and yee shal find rest vnto your soules.</hi> For why, the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:213"/> seede of Gods worde, in the hearts of those that are meeke, and receiue it with meekenesse and humblenesse of Spirite, is fruitfull, as in good ground, according to the Parable, <hi>Luke.</hi> 8, 15. whereas on the contrary, vnto such as haue proud &amp; vntractable hearts, it is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, as in euill ground. For God (as you heard before) <hi>resisteth the proude, and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk. Behold, he that lifteth vp himselfe, his minde is not vpright in him, but the iust shall liue by his faith, yea, indeede the proud man is as he that transgresseth by wine, therefore shall he not endure.</hi> Now for the Vses. First, seeing it is euident by this doctrine, that there is a very great difference betwixt the elect, and the Reprobate, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word, that therefore in the feare of God, we measure &amp; examin our selues heereby, what our estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is before the lord. It is not inough to heare the word of God, no nor yet to heare it so diligently, and with such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as that we can remember it, and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:213"/> make vse and application of it vnto our selues: For so did the Pharisees, as wee see <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. and thus much doo, and may many other wicked and vngodly persons at this day. But heere lieth the point. If when we heare the word of God purely preached, we so regard and remember it, and make such Vse thereof, as that wee can acknowledge in our harts the truth, the holinesse and authority of it, and bee moued by Gods spirit to say in our harts with the Prophet and Apostle, as <hi>Rom.</hi> x.xv. <hi>How beautiful are the feete of them that bring glad tidings of peace, and bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of good things?</hi> If hearing what God requireth at our hands, what wee ought to doo, to please him withall, and what to eschew, least he bee displeased, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in our hearts to glorifie him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, praying for grace and Heauenly assistance: if hearing the sweete promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Gods free grace and mercy in christ Iesus, wee be thereby allured to the loue of God, and to the magnifying of his Mercie, with an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our owne vnworthinesse: If at
<pb facs="tcp:150910:214"/> the denouncing of Gods iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin, we tremble in our hearts, and be touched with remorse, in regarde of our manifold transgressions, grow in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of them, and vnfainedly desire grace to eschew sinne, and to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it (for the time to come) in al the lusts and temptations thereof. If (I say) we perceiue our selues thus prepared and sanctified for the hearing and applying of the word of God, when it is preached vnto vs, and so as thereupon we zealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly settle and resolue our selues to growe in knowledge, faith, and al other graces, according to the seuerall Doctrines and exhortations which are deliuered vnto vs, and the diuers occasions that are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Heerein shall we haue a most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and comfortable testimony, that wee are the children of God, &amp; do belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal life, there being in this life no greater argument of Gods especial loue towards any, then if when the worde is preached, hee open their eies for a right conceiuing and vnderstanding of that which is taught, and there-withall also
<pb facs="tcp:150910:214"/> sanctify and prepare their hearts for such an inward entertaining and applying of it, as I spake of before. But now on the contrary, if wee feele not these effectes, how is it possible for vs to haue this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance? After this maner, if we examin our selues and others, according to the state and condition of the time, wherein we now liue, we shal see sufficient cause of mourning and lamentation. Manie come to the hearing of Gods word, and some surely so regard it when it is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that they can apply it to thēselues and others. When they heare vain swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, cursing, scoffing, whoredom, lying, filthy speaking, malice, enuy, contention and such like things, discouered, reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and condemned; they are not so blockish and sencelesse, but the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of such as are guilty, are constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to accuse them, that this and that is surely meant and spoken of them, and of such as they are. Heereby (I say) are such put in minde that they vse to swear vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to curse, to scoffe, to lye, and they cannot but be moued heerupon, to think
<pb facs="tcp:150910:215"/> that the preacher surely aymeth at them, because they are malicious, enuious, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to contention, quarelling &amp; debate, &amp;c. Now this so far, were not amis, that men shoulde thus obserue and apply the Doctrine preached, but when instead of leauing or forsaking either their swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or their lying, scoffing, their malice, or strife, when they heare it reprooued, they more and more flatter and harden themselues therein, and become puffed vppe with proude conceits, as men that thinke scorne to bee taught and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and therewithall (like the Pharises) become enraged against the Ministers whom God hath set ouer them, as if all were spoken &amp; done of malice, how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and necessarily soeuer it arise frō the Text: this is such a marking &amp; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods word, as is euen accursed of God, and carieth in the forhead of it, the very seale and marke of a reprobat mind. And yet whether the case doth thus stād with many at this day, who come to the hearing of Gods word, and mark and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it rather to the hardening of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="tcp:150910:215"/> in their peruerse and proude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and in their corrupt and vnwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wayes, then in any measure for the humbling of soules, and building vp of themselues towardes Gods Kingdome, I referre to euery mans Conscience, to examine and conclude.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Text and the Doctrine deliuered thereupon, serueth most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for the answering of two obiections, the one concerning the Ministers of the Gospell, and the other concerning some of such as are hearers. It is a common Obiection in the mouths of some, to the reproch (as they would haue it) of some of Christs seruants, who preach to them the word of God, that they are vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in their places, that God dooth not blesse their labors, and that their vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet &amp; vnwarranted proceedings in the duties of their calling, &amp; in the course of their life, is a great stumbling block in the waies of the hearers, and a maine reason wherfore the people for the most part be so carelesse in matters of religion, so litle profit by that which is taught, and take
<pb facs="tcp:150910:216"/> so little regarde of walking in obedience accordingly. And through this conceite do they take libertie to them-selues, for an odious and vnchristian contempt and despising of Gods Ministers. And so, as forgetting themselus, and neuer looking vpon their owne wayes, they cast the falt of all the euill that is among them, vpon such as continually labour to doo vnto them the greatest good. I will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the persons, for that cannot be (as I freely confesse) without intollerable pride and blasphemy, but respecting the causes (which are one and the same) with as good right, might they so condemne the holye prophets and Apostles as the causes and authours of the peoples igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, coldnesse, and carelesnesse in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of al other euil in the daies that they liued. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> preached to the people of his time, aboue sixtie years, and the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> aboue 40. and all the other Prophets proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and now I trust, they will not say, that the want of either discretion, or good gouernment in the doctrine or life
<pb facs="tcp:150910:216"/> of these holye men, was the cause of the euill which was then among the people, yet with how small fruit they preached, and how litle good they did with al their labour and endeuour, besides the whole course of their writings, and their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table complaints whereof I haue spoken before, the euent of Gods iudgements in punishing the Iewes, doth further proue. For, for that onely cause I meane, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning Gods word, and for disobeying and persecuting the Prophets, did the Lord bring vpon them the king of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who in the ninth yeare of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> came and besieged <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and in the eleuenth yeare tooke and ransacked it. God thus plaguing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his worde, when after so long preaching no fruit would follow: &amp; yet was not the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in fault, nor other the true prophets of God: for the inuasion of these strangers, for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of this noble City, or for the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous captiuity of this miserable people; but the loosenesse of their owne liues, &amp; their great contempt and ingratitude in
<pb facs="tcp:150910:217"/> those respects I spake before, most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily brought this fearefull plague and iudgement vppon them. The like might be sayde of Christ, and of his Apostles &amp; Disciples, they most diligently preached among the Iewes, but with small fruite, if wee consider either the purity of the Doctrine, the excellency of the teachers, or the wonderfull workes and myracles, that wer by gods power wrought for the confirmation of that which was taught. Now, althogh there be no comparison betwixt the persons, as I said before, yet the doctrine which we preach is one and the same that Christ &amp; his apostles haue taught before vs, and left vnto vs. And this further, I do not doubt, may be bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly spoken, that howsoeuer our aduersaries, by reason of our infirmities, haue more matter, and greater likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; yet surely, as the ancient accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wicked against Christ and his Apostles, were nothing but a colour and pretence of reprobate mindes, to feede themselues in the wicked contempte of Gods word, and in a loose and vnbridled
<pb facs="tcp:150910:217"/> kind of life; so is there no other account to bee made of the greatest part of such slanders and reproaches as are vttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ministers of the Gospel at this day. It is not my purpose (as God is my record) to patronize any thing that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that calling may be found euil or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse; nay, it shalbe far from me (throgh Gods grace) to iustifye my selfe in any thing at all, that vpon due triall &amp; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be found worthy of reproof. For better were it (I confesse) that Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones were hanged about our necks, and that we were cast in the midst of the Sea, rather then our life or euill doing should be such an offence, as to hinder any one in the way of saluation. But my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, to take from the men of this worlde, such pretences and excuses as they make, to nuzzle them-selues in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious life. And to let it appeare, that that which they alledge and Obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ministers of Christ, is not the main cause wherfore the sincerity of the gospell is so little regarded, our lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus christ in that parable. <hi>Ma.</hi> 13. teacheth
<pb facs="tcp:150910:218"/> men to iudge otherwise, to look into thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, &amp; to search their own bosoms for the cause and reason wherfore the word of God hath no more place in them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the seed-sower bee neuer so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest a man, and most skilfull and cunning in his trade, though hee make neuer so good choise of his seede, and be neuer so carefull to purge and cleare it from al da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; yet if the ground bee barren and naught, his labor is lost, and no good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect can follow thereupon. And on the contrary, though the sower bee neuer so vnskilful in sowing, and haue no desire at all that the seed which he soweth should growe and prosper; yet if the seede bee good, and the ground too, it will grow and bring forth fruit. Now, as the word of God is the seede, so is the ground the hearts and minds of such as heare it prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. A good heart, wheresoeuer, or of whomsoeuer it heare Gods worde, nay though it be but read of a childe, yet will it enter into him, and do him good. But a godlesse heart, a prophane and Wicked man, though hee heare neuer so good a
<pb facs="tcp:150910:218"/> man preach, nay though Christ himself, or an Angell from heauen, should speak vnto him, and say, this is the doctrine of saluation, giue good eare vnto it, beleeue and embrace it; or this is the good and right way, walke directly therein; yet would he be neuer the better, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as prophane (if not become worse) then euer before. And this may suffice for the answer to the first obiection. For the second; it seemeth strange to manie that are well minded, that the doctrin of the gospel, being (as it is) so purely and plentifully preached, and so wisely, so plainly and perticulerly applied to mens consciences, should yet be no more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the reformation of mens hearts, and to the amendment of their liues, that men should bee so little allured with the sweet promises of Gods grace and mercy in Christ Iesus, or so little terrified with the denouncing of Gods iudgements. It makes them wonder, that any man that is eyther a vaine swearer, or a scoffer, or a lyer, or a filthy speaker, and that is guilty in himselfe, either of malice, or enuy, of

O Lord (say they) what a pittifull thing is this, that any shoulde thus wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shut their eyes, that they may not see, stop their eares, that they may not heare, and thus harden their hearts, that they might not vnderstand? To see a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist (that refuseth to come to our assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where the word of God is preched) to bee thus minded and thus hardned in the lusts and affections of his own heart, it is not strange. But for any man that carrieth the name and countenance of a Protestant and professor of the Gospell, and that enioyeth an ordinary ministerie for his instruction and direction, to bee thus euill affected, it seemeth vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly very straunge, and is a great asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment vnto many; yea, and makes many good men, not onely to sigh &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but euen with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalm. cxix.

They heereby wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shutting agaynst themselues the gate of Gods kingdom; &amp; whereas the word of God is in it selfe, and vnto the elect of God, a sweet sauor of life, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of God to saluation, they make it by this meanes, vnto them, the sauour of death &amp; condemnation, to their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confusion for euermore. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest also in the example of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:150910:221"/> being a stubborn people, and most mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously bent against Christ, because hee would not flatter them in their sins, but plainly and particularly applied his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine vnto their consciences. No other effects can we see (in the greatest part of them) by all his preaching and continual exhortations, but the effects of men gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to a reprobate sense. Somtimes astonishment, sometimes palpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, somtimes mocking, wresting, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting, slandring, persecuting, no sound knowledge, no true faith, no true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no true zeal of gods glory, no fruit or effect of true loue, nor any other thing at all, that might either bring them true peace of cōscience, or tend to the sealing of their saluation. So that this may bee a lesson, nay a fearful example for vs, &amp; for all posterities and generations to come, that we may learne to take heed how we harden our harts, or be malicious against those whom God hath sent to break vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the breade of life, least God forsake vs, yea euen whilest hee speaketh vnto vs by his seruants, in the ordinary Ministry
<pb facs="tcp:150910:222"/> and preaching of the gospel. But that we humble our selues before the Lord, and craue the gracious aide and assistance of his holy spirit. It being most sure &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that vnlesse the Lord ioyne the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of his spirite with the outwarde sound and ministry of his word, we shall be as malicious, as ignorant, as peeuish and peruerse, as farre from hauing any sound comfort by that which we heare, as were the Iewes, whose fearfull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is thus set before vs. And therefore, how highly it standeth vs vpon, to pray and beseech the Lord, so to prepare and sanctify our eares and hearts, that we be not idle, vnfruitful, and vnprofitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Gods worde, when it is preached vnto vs, but that we may euermore hear it, with that manner of hearing, which is proper and peculier to Gods Children, with feare and trembling, as the Worde proceeding out of Gods owne mouth, and with ioy and cheerefulnesse, as the word of life, yea, euen as the power of God, to the euerlasting peace and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our soules: I neede not vrge it

The elect, howsoeuer they may be blinde and ignoraunt, obstinate and vntowarde, and carelessely runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long euen according vnto the lustes and
<pb facs="tcp:150910:223"/> affections of their owne hearts, with the prophane multitude of the world, to the wayes &amp; delights of sin and vngodlines, yet is it but for a time. The Lorde of his infinite goodnesse and mercy (before it be too late) most graciously calling and conuerting them from darknes to light; from sin vnto righteousnes, from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Sathan vnto his Maiesty, that so they may obtaine forgiuenesse of theyr sinnes, and inheritance among them that are sanctifyed by faith in Christ Iesus. Whereas the Wicked and vngodly, as (through the corruption of their owne nature, and instigation of Sathan) their hearts and affections are set with delight on those things that are euill &amp; naught; euen so, doo they continue and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from euil to woorse, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of Conscience, vntill they haue heaped vp the full measure thereof, for their iust condemnation. According to that of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 13. <hi>Euil men and deceiuers shal wax worse and worse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and being deceiued.</hi> Thus stood the case with the Iews for the most part. As
<pb facs="tcp:150910:223"/> in the dayes of the Prophets, <hi>Elias</hi> &amp; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> they were giuen ouer to idolatry &amp; other abhominations, to infidelity and hardnesse of heart, contemned Gods worde, despised and persecuted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, euen so (as the Apostle heere gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to vnderstand) did they so continue vnto that very time wherein hee liued. <hi>The rest haue bin hardned</hi> saith he, <hi>vnto this day.</hi> To this also most plainly, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 14 15. <hi>Their mindes</hi> (saith he) <hi>are hardned, for vntil this day, remaineth the same couering vntaken away.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is laid ouer their hearts.</hi> And after this manner, (through the iust iudgement of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) doo the greatest part of them remaine in the like Ignorance, blindnes, infidelity, obstinacy, &amp; hardheartednes, euen vnto these very daies of ours wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we our selues do now liue. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, whensoeuer either their owne consciences doo reproue them for sinne, or others do exhort and admonish them, howsoeuer for a time they may passe it ouer, and regarde it not; yet at
<pb facs="tcp:150910:224"/> length they will bethinke themselues, be touched with remorse, and glorify God in the fruits of repentance and newnesse of life. <hi>Dauid</hi> sinned greeuously in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery &amp; murther, but being an elect childe of God, he was no sooner brought to a serious sense and consideration of his sin by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> as 2 Sam. 12, 13. but with a penitent heart hee confessed the same. <hi>Peter</hi> also, greatly offended in denying his Lorde and Maister, but hee was no sooner put in minde of his sinne, by the crowing of the Cocke, but (as we may see, <hi>Math.</hi> 26, 75.) he wept most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to consider his fall. <hi>Paule,</hi> before his conuersion, was a greeuous persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Church of Christ, making ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of all such as professed his Name, asmuch as lay in him, but being an elect and chosen Vessell of God, hee was no sooner admonished and exhorted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but he presently setled himself to obey the Lords wil, as <hi>Acts</hi> 9, 6. <hi>Lord</hi> (sayth he) <hi>what wilt thou that I doo?</hi> As if hee sayde, I am now ready to performe whatsoeuer it shall please thee to enioyn
<pb facs="tcp:150910:224"/> or commaund. But now, how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heereunto, is the affection and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of wicked &amp; vngodly reprobates, we haue examples in <hi>Kain, Pharaoh, Esau, Ahab, Iudas,</hi> and in the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, who although they were guiltie in their Consciences of great and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous transgressions, and often admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and exhorted to Repentaunce, yet they still continued in their lewdnesse, &amp; what outward shew of remorse soeuer, they at any time made, it was altogether in Hypocrisie and dissimulation. What our generall estate and condition is by Nature, how we are thereby dead in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and sinnes, hauing no more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor ability in our selues to recouer the spirituall life lost, then there is power in a dead carkasse, to restore it selfe to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life: the holye Scripture dooeth plentifully declare, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 21. <hi>Colos.</hi> 2, 13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2, 1. and in many other places, as wee haue had often occasion to consider at large. But nowe, howsoeuer thus by Nature stands the case with all men, yet such among the rest, as doo belong vnto
<pb facs="tcp:150910:225"/> eternall life, the Lord doth not alwayes leaue in this wretched condition, but in due &amp; conuenient time deliuereth them from the power of darknesse, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them into the liberty of his adopted children, and sanctifyeth them for the aduancement of Gods glory, and for the sealing of their owne saluation, in the fruits of the spirit, in all goodnesse, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and truth, according to their seuerall places and callinges, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers occasions that are offred. Dost thou then see any man carelesly and securely continuing in his old and former sinnes, that either from his cradle or otherwise heeretofore, hath bin a vaine swearer, or a blasphemer, a whoremaster, a drunkard, a wrangler, a scoffer, giuen to contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, quarrelling, or debate, a lyer, a filthy speaker, an oppressor, or a backbiter, and notwithstanding all wholesome instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exhortations that tend to the contrary, continues so stil; is stil a known and a notorious transgessor in these or in any of thē; as som such there are, who by any good means that can be vsed, wil not be
<pb facs="tcp:150910:225"/> reclaimed, but alwaies continue in their vnregenerate estate, hauing so accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them-selues to these and such like things, and growne to such an habite in them, that there is nowe no more hope of their chaunging to the better, then of the blacke Moore his changing his skin, and the <hi>Leopard his spots,</hi> as speaketh the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ch. 13. Wel know such a one, whosoeuer he be, and mark him out from among all others, to bee in a most desperate and miserable condition. And howsoeuer the Lord God in mercy may heerafter cal &amp; bring such to repentance (which is euermore to be desired &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, if it may stād with his blessed wil) yet know their estate in the meane time, (I say againe) to be most fearful. And let al others learn by the example of such (as they tender the glory of God, and their owne saluation) to beware and take heed of continuing in sin. It being the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods children when they are called and conuerted, to be so altred and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from their former corrupt &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted conuersation, that howsoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:150910:226"/> they cannot glorifie God in such perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they woulde; yet the desires of their hearts, and the endeuours of their liues, are wholly addicted thereunto, and set thereupon. Whereas before, they were full of <hi>vnrighteousnesse, fornication, wickednesse, &amp;c.</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh of the vnregenerate Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.) being called and conuerted, they become <hi>Ful of goodnesse, filled with al knowledge, &amp; are able to admonish one another,</hi> as he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the conuerted Gentiles, Rom. 15. Whereas before, all the Religion which they had, was onely in wordes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewes, vpon their conuersion, it presently beginneth to be in al goodnes, righteousnes, and trueth, they hauing a care &amp; a conscience to amend their liues &amp; to practise in the whole course of their conuersation, whatsoeuer they know &amp; professe, according to the wil &amp; word of God. If before they were vain swearers, now they haue regarde to vse the Name of god with high reuerence whensoeuer they speake or thinke of it. If before they haue bin vnchast &amp; dissolute, nowe they
<pb facs="tcp:150910:226"/> haue a care to keepe their bodies &amp; souls chast and pure, as becom the temples of the holy ghost: If before they were giuen to quarrelling, contention, &amp; strife, now they are peace-makers, seeke it, &amp; follow after it: If before they haue bin scoffers, raylers, filthy talkers, or slanderers, now their care wil be to speake the wordes of truth &amp; sobernes, that no corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication proceed out of their mouths but that which is good to edification, &amp; may minister grace to those that heare them: yea, and thus stands the case with them, as touching all other perticulers that may be remembred. According as of this difference betwixt the estate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of gods children, considered both before &amp; after their calling &amp; conuersion speaketh the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ye being in time past, Gentiles in the flesh, &amp; cald vncircumcision of thē which are called circumsion in the flesh made with hands, that ye were (I say) at that time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, and were aliants from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Israel, &amp; were strangers from the Couenants of promise, and had no hope,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:227"/> and were without God in the world. But now in Christ Iesus, ye which once were far off, are made neere by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, &amp;c.</hi> Heereof the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> also 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 10. <hi>Which in time past,</hi> saith he, <hi>were not a people, yet are now the people of God, which in time past were not vnder mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but now haue obtained mercy.</hi> And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 9, 10, 11. after the Apostle hath recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp a great number of wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly liuers, <hi>Fornicaters, idolaters, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, wantons, drunkards, raylers,</hi> &amp; such like, plainly denouncing, that no <hi>such shal inherit the kingdom of God:</hi> hee presently addeth, saying, <hi>And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are iustified in the name of the Lord Iesus, &amp; by the spirit of our God.</hi> Much might bee spoken, and many other places alledged, but by this already deliuered, wee may plainly see, what a great change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Lord dooth worke and bring to passe in all those that do belong vnto him. In all those (I say) that doo belong vnto him; for the Wicked, howsoeuer they may sometimes haue some prick of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:227"/> conscience, and sodaine motions vnto that which is good, and so as they may seeme to be sorry for their sins, and verie resolute to walke in newnesse of life; yet as such motions are neuer wrought in them by Gods sanctifying spirit, so haue they neuer any certainty of continuance, but as a flame or flash of fire in strawe or stubble, as they suddainly arise vpon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal respects, so as sodanly do they vanish &amp; passe away againe. Their stony hearts cannot be made flesh; all is quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and they are still the same men they were before. So then we see heere (to conclude withall) that one course is to be taken with the godly, and another with the wicked, aswel in the Ministry &amp; preaching of the Gospell, as otherwise. Such as continue in their lewdnesse, and will not bee reformed (but harden their harts, and make stiffe their neckes against such wholsom aduise and counsel as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereunto.) Such are to be reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and vpbraided, aswell with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as with their daily transgressions. A man may boldly say to such a one, thou
<pb facs="tcp:150910:228"/> hast alwayes bin of a lewd and vngodlye disposition, as eyther in this or in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and so thou art stil; we shal do such no wrong at all, though wee lay to their charge, and vrge to their Consciences, one and the same sinne and offence, and that againe and againe, yea, so long as they continue therein without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But when a man that hath bin of a lewd disposition, is now become an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man. If he were in time past, either a vaine swearer, or a whore-monger, or a drunkard, a malicious, enuious, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious person, or any other way euill inclined, and hath now left his olde and former sinne, and endeuoureth to walke in a better way. It standeth with no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Gods word, to obiect any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer matter at all, to the disgrace of such a one. But God is to be glorifyed for his Conuersion, and the party encouraged by all good meanes to a zealous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the obedience of the trueth. So that fitly are all such heere met withall, and iustly reprooued, who (to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the glorious Gospell of Iesus
<pb facs="tcp:150910:228"/> Christ which they professe) are very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to vpbraide those that feare god with the sins and transgressions of their vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate estate with such faults &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions as they haue cōmitted before the time of their calling. As many such there are, who if they heare any thing vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the praise and commendation of any man (for godlines &amp; religion) whom they do not affect. If they knowe or can call to minde, or do but heare of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted behauiour, committed by thē in the former part of their life, great or smal; how long ago soeuer it wer done, &amp; how penitent soeuer for it, they haue bin since, yet will they be sure, eyther to cast it in their teeth (if they presently con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer with them,) or to blaze it abroade to the greatest reproach and disgrace of them, they possibly may. Thus did not the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> deale with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. After their calling and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, hee vpbrayded them not with their former Idolatry and prophanesse, howe great and horrible soeuer it were, <hi>But God be thanked</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, 17
<pb facs="tcp:150910:229"/>
               <hi>That ye haue beene the seruants of sin, but ye haue obeyed from the heart, &amp;c.</hi> And thus (I say) ought we to do, reproaching onely such with their former transgressions, who wilfully and shamelesly continue in them, but neuer obiecting to the disgrace of any reformed Christian, what he hath bin in times past, but giuing thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for that hee is now. And the which, to the end we may do in vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of hart, and without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as occasion may be offered: Let vs humble our selues before God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and craue the gracious assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and direction of his blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine arising hence in the first place, is this; that true Faith, and pride, (I meane pride, not as it is an infirmity in Gods Children, but as it is a raigning sinne in the wicked) cannot possibly stand and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together. That such as haue proud and haughty hearts, cannot possibly stand in the State of Grace, can neither true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue, nor religiously submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto the word and Gospell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. This is the Doctrine, the which as it is directly offered in this Text, so doth our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe expresly confirme it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.44. Where directing his speech vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> hee hath these wordes; <hi>How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone?</hi> and this is manifest in the Pharisies, who being puffed vp with a high conceit of themselues, scornefully reiected, and disdained the simplicity of the Gospell, preached vnto them by Christ himselfe: as we may see. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.9. and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. This may yet further appeare by plentifull other testimonies and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">Nu. 15, 30.</note> where it is expressely
<pb facs="tcp:150910:233"/> pronounced, that whosoeuer doth ought presumptuously or in the pride of his hart, he is so farre from beleeuing aright, as that he is guilty, euen of blaspheming <hi>The Lord, and therefore shall be cut off from among his people.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (for his part) is so far from hauing any tollerable conceit that it is possible for a proude and high minded man to bee the Childe of God, and truely and faithfully to belieue in Christ, as that he flatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth. <hi>Psalme</hi> 101. that he will not suffer such a one <hi>to dwell in his house.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 101, 5</note>
                  <hi>Him that hath a proude looke</hi> (saith he) <hi>and an high hart, I cannot suffer.</hi> Of such pronounceth <hi>Salomon.</hi>

Now, if proud and high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men be hated of God, and an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination vnto him, and if they are also to be hated of all such as feare God: It stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with no reason, to imagine or think that such can possibly stand by faith in the State of grace, for true Faith is a speciall guift of Gods grace: and shal we
<pb facs="tcp:150910:233"/> say, that God giueth such speciall graces vnto those whom he hateth, and are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable in his sight? It is surely vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. <hi>Their heart was exalted</hi> (saith the Lord of the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 13, 6.</note>

Because <hi>their heart was exalted.</hi> So we see, that a proud and high minded man, cannot so much as truelie remember God, much lesse then faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue in Christ, and humbly submit himselfe to the Doctrine of his word. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold hee that lifteth vp himselfe</hi> (saith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Habacuk.</hi> chapt. 2.) <hi>his mind is not vpright in him,</hi>

                  <hi>but the iust shall liue by his Faith: yea, indeed the proud Man is as hee that transgresseth by Wine, therefore shall he not endure, &amp;c.</hi> In which wordes we see a manifest opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene pride and faith. And by all these places wee haue this truth most cleerely confirmed, that it is not possible that a proud and high minded man should true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully beleeue in Christ. Now secondly we are to obserue, that pride &amp; ambition doe commonly goe together, there beeing hardly a proude man that is
<pb facs="tcp:150910:234"/> not ambitious, nor an ambitious man that is not proud. And in whomsoeuer these are seated by the Deuill (for hee is the Authour of them) there is nothing so wicked, vile, and abhominable, but such men will affect it, and are apt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thereunto.

Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was the roote and Fountaine of all this. And by these examples it is very cleare, that there is nothing so vile and abhominable, but proud and ambitious men are inclinable vnto it. Nowe, as pride and ambition, so also doe pride and vaine boasting commonly goe together, as heereof we haue examples in <hi>Ahashue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosh.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:234"/> Hest.</hi> 1. who sitting vpon the Throne of his Kingdome, made a feast to all his Princes and Officers, boasting of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of the glory of his Kingdome.<note place="margin">Est. 1, 2, 3, 4 Est. 5, 11, 12</note> In <hi>Haman</hi> Chapt. 5. boasting himselfe of the glory of his riches, and wherein the King did magnifie him aboue all others. And Dan. 4. we read of King <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> how walking in his royall Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Babell,</hi> boasted of his greatnesse,<note place="margin">Dan 4, 26, 27.</note> saying; <hi>Is not this great Babell, that I haue built for the house of the Kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Maiesty?</hi> And of such vaine boasters there are many other examples; some glorying in their Riches; some boasting of their strength; some bragging of their credite, of the fauour of great men, and such like. But now before we proceed any further, let vs consider how odious a sinne this is in the sight of God, and that by calling to minde the fearefull punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and iudgements inflicted and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vpon proude, ambitious, and high minded men, vpon vaine glorying, and vaine boasting persons. And first, what a fearefull punnishment was inflicted vpon our first Parents, when as not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

And first touching matters of Religion and godlinesse. Although such as are proud and high minded, bee
<pb facs="tcp:150910:236"/> very farre from sound knowledge, and al sanctifying graces; yea, ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull in the very first principles, yet like the Pharasies (of whom Christ speaketh. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.) because they can set a better face vpon the matter then the common sort, they are commonly puffed vp with such arrogant conceits, as if they wanted no necessary grace, and as if nothing were hid from their vnderstanding. Such as are proud and high minded, come to the hearing of Gods word when it is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, with preiudicate opinions, not to learne, and to bee builded vp towardes Gods Kingdome, but to finde some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if it bee possible) to cauell with the Minister, and to disgrace him in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and so vttring (when opportunitie serues their turne) not onelie ignorance and mallice, but oftentimes also euen flat blasphemy, and that after an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and most shamelesse manner. Neuer shall you heare proud and high minded men, eyther penitently acknowledge any thing in them to be amisse, or in humility and lowlinesse desire of the Minister, or of any other, to be taught and instructed in the way of saluation: but these are
<pb facs="tcp:150910:236"/> peremptory Censurers and Controllers of whatsoeuer crosseth their peeuish and peruerse affections: let it neuer so plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare to proceede from God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word. By no meanes can such men abide the wordes of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but labour will they with all possible meanes to quench the Spirit, and to tye the tongue of the Minister, that hee may either not speake at all, or no otherwise then they would haue him. It is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to wrest and peruert wholesome Doctrine, to scorne and chase, and to shew themselues highly discontented, if the Minister reprooue any thing that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them, how farre soeuer it be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from his intent or purpose. These and such like effects, are ordinarily seene among such as are proud and high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men. Againe, if such men haue any knowledge at all in heauenly thinges (as some of them haue) their knowledge, by reason of their pride being not sanctified, dooth nothing but puffe them vp: They will professe much, and none so great tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers as they, but no care nor conscience shall you see of an agreeable practise.

And now to proceede to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instances. If such as are proud and high minded be preferred before others, (as commonly they are) in the riches, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, countenance, and estimation of the World, whereas they should apply their wealth, and the greater meanes God hath giuen them to the glory of God, and to the good of their Bretheren, they imploy al, to the discountenancing of good men, and of good causes, and to the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of euill men, and of bad causes.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:239"/> Whereas they should approoue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be such as they would be acoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by labouring to excell the common sort in good and commendable actions, to the benefite either of the Church or Common-weale; as also in bountifulnes and liberality, in beeing humble, affable, courteous, louers of peace, &amp;c. which are indeed the true ornaments of a true Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: they contrariwise by their boasts and brags, when there is no vse nor need of them, and by their beggarly pursses, when they should doe good, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating into all other contrary extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; of Noble (as the <hi>Heralds</hi> speake) become Ignoble, lose all iust claime of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and preheminence, and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make themselues as base, as the basest of all. Againe, proud and high minded men are commonly contentious. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith. <hi>Prouer.</hi> 13. <hi>Onely by pride doth man make contention.</hi> And marke it who will, there is hardly a proud man that is not contentious, nor a contentious man that is not proud. All contention, quarrelling, strife, and debate, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions and separations in the places of their aboade, being ordinarily stirred vp
<pb facs="tcp:150910:240"/> by such, who with their high words, state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gestures, imperious speeches, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory censures would ouer-sway all things at their pleasures. If there be any such dwelling among you, either ye must let them haue their owne wils, how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or peruerse soeuer it be, although they bee neuer so prophane Contemners of the Gospell and Religion of IESVS CHRIST, in the Ministry and profession of it: neuer so furious and outragious, neuer such ordinary abusers of Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Name, in swearing, curssing, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, make a common custome of prophaning the Lords day in themselues, and in their Children and Familie, in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the holy exercises, and in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many thinges which they should not doe. Although they be neuer so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane scoffers, railers, silthy talkers, neuer so great lyars, Back-byters; nay, though they take in hand neuer such wicked and vnconscionable practises, not only to the vniust vexation of their Neighbours, but to the hurt and oppression, euen of the poore and Fatherlesse: yet if ye will bee quiet, and loue your owne ease, you must let them alone, and not presume to aske
<pb facs="tcp:150910:240"/> them why they doe so? For if you eyther exhort them to a better course, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue or finde fault with them, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you go about by ordinary means to crosse their wils, and to bring them to reason whether they wil or no: their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice will presently grow to bee so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and vnmeasurable, that they wil not care what they say, nor what they do, no nor what they sweare, so as one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may hurt and despight such as contradict and oppose against them, and reuenge themselues. This property of a proud and high minded man, well knew <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he saith yet further. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. <hi>He that is of a proud heart, stirreth vp strife.</hi> Lastly, such as are proud and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, are ready to iudge the same of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

But now, that our Lord Iesus Christ was not ambitious nor vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as they most wickedly and vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably conceiued of him; neither at any time sought to be famous, but as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of his calling made him so: it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, not only by the often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements which he gaue for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of his maruellous woorkes and heauenly glory. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.17.<note place="margin">Math. 9, 30 Math. 17, 9</note> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places; but also hereof haue we a notable example. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. where we may read, that although hee had done such a wonderfull Miracle, in healing the Man that had been diseased thirty eight years, as in regard whereof he might iustly haue expected the praise and commendation of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:150910:244"/> auaile vs to be accounted great or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the World, and vile and wretched in the sight of God? to be flattred, applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and commended of fraile and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men, and as loathsome and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to be hated and abhorred of God? Hereunto may be added for further am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification, that notable exhortation of the Apostle <hi>Paule. Ephe.</hi> 2. <hi>That nothing be done through contention or vaine glory, but that in meekenesse of minde, euery Man esteeme other better then himselfe.</hi> But now if hereupon it be demanded, how he that doth in truth and indeede excell and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe another in any guift, grace, or good quality, should possibly think such a one to be better then himselfe? Such and such (will a proud and high minded man bee ready to say) are but Blocke-heades, and Beetleheads, there is nothing in them to be regarded, and shall I thinke them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then my selfe? I think great scorne to be compared with such. But when the Apostle exhorteth vs to think others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our selues, his meaning is not that wee should in this sort examine our selues and other men. But that on the one side we should take a due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:150910:244"/> of the vertues and good thinges that are in others, how weake or small soeuer they bee; and on the other side, examine and take a good view of our owne sinnes and infirmities. That we should not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our guifts and the good thinges that are in vs, with the guifts and good things that are in them: but our wants and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, with their graces. For what is the cause that some are puffed vp with such high conceits, as that they grudge at their Superiors, enuy their equals, and disdaine their Inferiours, as if in comparison of themselues, few or none were worthy of any account? Surely, because on the one side, they neuer marke with a charitable iudgement, the vertues and good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are in others: and on the other side, haue their owne hearts voide of true humilitie, and their consciences touched with no consideration or remorse for sin. To the ende therefore, wee may haue a comfortable testimony, that we stand by faith in the State of Grace, and in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted hope of eternall life, it highly behooueth vs to pray vnto God, to settle and establish in vs true humility and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of minde, as being the beginning,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:245"/> the middle part, and the ende of a true Christian life, all pride and arrogancy of heart beeing vtterly expelled and rooted out. Remembring yet further, that when <hi>Salomon</hi> saith. Prouer. 6.<note place="margin">Pro. 6, 16, 17.</note>
                  <hi>That the Lord hateth sixe thinges, and that his Soule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth seauen.</hi> The first of all he plainelie expresseth, to be <hi>The haughtie eyes.</hi> And therefore it is notably recorded of <hi>Dauid</hi> 2 Sam. 6. that when <hi>Michall</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Saule</hi> despised him in her heart, and was so farre from yeelding him honour that was due vnto him, and which hee might iustly haue exacted at her hands, as that she disgraced him (as much as lay in her) with reproachfull tearmes: so great was his humilitie, and so farre from all pride and ambition, as that among other words this was part of his answer;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6, 22</note>
                  <hi>I will yet be more vile then thus, and will bee low in mine owne sight.</hi> Now a notable way and meanes to attaine to true humility, is to bee touched in conscience by the consideration of our sinnes, where-with we are polluted and defiled in euery part of both body and Soule: For surely, if we rightly enter into the examination of our sinnes, we shall easily find sufficient cause
<pb facs="tcp:150910:245"/> of honouring and preferring others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our selues. Our owne consciences telling vs, that it is almost vnpossible that other men should be such great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinners, haue such corrupt thoughts, affections, and desires, and goe so often and many waies astray, as wee our selues are guilty of in our selues, and priuie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For our owne sinnes and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we may know in a great measure, but nothing so certainely or particularly the sinnes and transgressions of other men. And therefore in comparison of other men, we ought to be humble in our own eies. Neither ought this onely to moue vs to humility, that wee are guilty in our consciences of great and hainous sinnes, but because they are also manifest and apparant before the face of God. For as the Apostle saith. Hebr. 4. <hi>All thinges are naked and open to his eyes.</hi> He is the Searcher of the heart, he knoweth what lyeth hid in the secret affections, so that howsoeuer we can bleare the eies of men, as if our waies and hearts were straight and vpright, yet God will finde vs out, we cannot deceiue him, nor so escape his mighty arme: all which ought to mooue
<pb facs="tcp:150910:246"/> vs to humility. Last of all, let vs know and consider with our selues, that if wee nourish pride and ambition in our harts, we shall thereby euen pollute and defile all the good guiftes of God, whatsoeuer are within vs. For euen as a corrupt humour when it hath once gotten the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand in a mans body, whatsoeuer is eate or drunke is easily turned into the same: euen so a high minde doth conuert all the gifts that are in man, into pride, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, and vaine boasting. For as the Apostle saith. Tit. 1.13.<note place="margin">Tit. 1, 13.</note>
                  <hi>Vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure, but euen their mindes and consciences are defiled.</hi> Let vs therefore in the feare of God, remembring yet further what <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith. Prou. 16.18.<note place="margin">Pro: 16, 18.</note>
                  <hi>That pride goeth before destruction,</hi> And that <hi>the Lord will destroy the house of the proud men,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely speaketh also in the Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:<note place="margin">Pro. 15, 25. Esay 29, 20. Obad: 3.</note> that <hi>The scornefull shall be consumed,</hi> as <hi>Esay</hi> denounceth. Chapt. 29. and that (as <hi>Obadiah</hi> saith) the pride of their heart shall deceiue the wicked: let vs therefore (I say) settle our selues to embrace true humilitie, and lowlinesse of minde, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it in our wordes, in our counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:246"/> in our apparrell, in our gestures, and in the whole course of our behauiour. As the Apostle exhorteth againe. Phil. 2.<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 5.</note>
                  <hi>Let the same minde bee in vs, that was</hi> in Christ Iesus. The Dignity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our Lord Iesus Christ was not let to him, but that he honoured vs euen with his owne reproch: no dignity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no calling, no credit, countenance, or authority, whereunto wee are, or may be exalted in this life, ought to be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment or hindrance, to restraine or withhold vs from being so humble in our own eyes, as that we esteem and account others better then our selues. Our Lord Iesus Christ came not to be ministred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but that hee himselfe should minister and doe seruice vnto others; yea, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen giue his life for the redemption of many. To the zealous imitation of whose example, doth hee most louinglie exhort vs. Math. 11.<note place="margin">Math: 11, 29</note> saying, <hi>Take my yoak on you, and learne of me, that I am meeke, and lowly in heart: and yee shall finde rest vnto your soules.</hi> The which guift and grace of right imitation, the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe vs for Christ Iesus sake.

               <head>But feare.</head>
               <p>THese words are rather an admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then a threatening; the purpose of the Apostle beeing not to make them doubtfull of their saluation, but to stirre them vp (as I told you the last time) to so much the more carefulnes and diligence, for the preseruation of that Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were endued. Now then for the Doctrines. First, in that the Apostle dooth th thus admonish the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of whom there was at that time a glorious Church, visibly appearing to the World. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> We may learne and obserue, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ, the wholesome exhortations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, &amp; reprehensions of the same, are necessary and profitable, not only for the weake and ignorant, and for such as are but Nouices in Religion, but euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the resolute and well instructed Christians, which are not ignorant, but throughly grounded and established in the truth. Such (I say) were the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom the Apostle heere admonisheth. They were called and conuerted to the Faith, they made a glorious profession of
<pb facs="tcp:150910:247"/> Christ and his Gospell; yea, they stood by faith in the State of Grace, and as hee saith yet further of them. Chap. 15.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8. Ro. 15, 14.</note>
                  <hi>They were full of goodnes, and filled with all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and able to admonish one another.</hi> And yet notwithstanding, all this we see heere how the Apostle thought it most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only to teach &amp; instruct them, that but also to exhort and admonish them, they walk worthy of the vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were called, and that they shold take heede they abuse it not. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this was not without heauenly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and consideration. For why? The Word and Gospell of Christ, containeth not onely Milke for the weake Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but strong meate for them that are of age; none so learned, but thereby hee may bee better instructed; none so wise, but thereby hee may learne to bee more wise; none so resolute, but may thereby bee confirmed; nor any so holy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but by the Doctrines, Admonitions, and Exhortations of Gods word, he may grow and increase in holinesse and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. How necessary therefore it is, that all generally; yea, euen as well the resolute and grounded Christians, as the
<pb facs="tcp:150910:248"/> rude and ignorant sort, as well those that know most, as such as vnderstand least, should be oftentimes exhorted, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and put in mind of their duties: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery soule that hath any spirituall feeling, may easily perceiue and vnderstand. For this cause most notably, thus writeth the Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1, 12.</note>
                  <hi>I will not be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to put you alwaies in remembrance of these things, though that ye haue knowledge, and be stablished in the present truth.</hi> Marke his words, that although those vnto whō hee wrote, were endued with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods word, and most excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded in the truth of Religion: yet did he account it most necessary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the discharge of his owne duty, but also of their saluation, alwaies to put them in remembrance of the same. Hereunto also appertaineth that of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2, 21.</note>
                  <hi>I haue not written vnto you</hi> (saith he) <hi>because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</hi> In which wordes, it is most cleere and euident, that the Doctrines, admonitions, and Exhortations of Gods word, are most necessary, and euen most especially to be applied, vnto such as are
<pb facs="tcp:150910:248"/> most skilfull in the waies of the Lord, that they may the more effectually goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the glory of GOD, and to the good example, winning, alluring, and drawing on of others. Such beeing the naturall dulnesse euen of the best, and so huge and bottomlesse their corruptions, as that vnlesse they bee oftentimes taught &amp; put in mind of their calling, and of the duties therof, the Spirit will be ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the flesh, and their Faith by little and little, weaken and decay, Christians therefore (I say) yea euen the best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that are, haue neede to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pricked forward and called vpon, that they forget not themselues, that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not their corruption to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and that they become not fruitlesse nor sloathfull in the workes of righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. The eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth of which point, as it tendeth to the worthy reproofe of all such (as many such there are at this day) puffed vp with such a proud conceit of their owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, knowledge, and sufficiency, as that they haue no neede at all in their owne perswasion, to be further instructed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,

<pb facs="tcp:150910:249"/> and let them account of such as are sent of God, to put them in remembrance of their duties, and are faithfull and painfull in this behalfe, as notable and precious Instruments of their saluation, saying with the Prophet and Apostle;<note place="margin">Esay 57, 7.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> is this. That a most excellent way and meanes for the preseruation of Faith, and for the vpholding of vs stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vprightlie in the way of saluation, is (together with humblenesse and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind) reuerently to worship and feare the Lord. Now, the true feare of the Lord, consisteth both in louing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of him. For the Lord God (as we must know) hath in himself the reuerence both of a Father, and of a Lord or Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, according to that. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Mal. 1, 6.</note>
                  <hi>If I bee a Father, where is mine honour? And if I be a Maister, where is my feare, saith the Lorde of Hoasts?</hi> So that whosoeuer will truelie
<pb facs="tcp:150910:250"/> feare, he must endeuour to shew himselfe, both an obedient Son, and a dutifull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. There must bee in him a reuerence mingled with honour and feare; not a feare of punishment, with a doubting of saluation, but a carefull study mixt with the loue and honour of God. Vnto this feare, it is that the Apostle heere exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not meaning thereby, (as I told you before) to make them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull and doubtfull of Gods speciall loue and fauour towards them to eternal life, but that they shold humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confesse his fatherly goodnesse and vnspeakable kindnesse towards them in Christ Iesus, and loue him vnfeignedly againe for the same: therewithall also bee sorry for their sinnes and great vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and most ardently desire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their reconciliation made by Christ. But let vs consider this some-what more particularly. The feare of God is commonly distinguished into a seruile &amp; childly feare.

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 14, 1.</note> There being none vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, so wicked an Atheist, none so hardned, sencelesse, or without remorse, but by the light of his owne conscience, and brightnesse of Gods truth, hee hath often within him some feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, by the sight and consideration of his sinnes, and of Gods fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced and threatned against the same. And how great paines soeuer such men take to go to the deuill, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their hearts in vnbeleefe, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and put out of their mindes, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and cogitations of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment to come: yet such is the strength of conscience, through the euidence (I say) of Gods truth, that they haue much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and stirring in them; yea, much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and perplexity, howsoeuer beeing giuen vp to a reprobate sence, it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not long together, but they harden themselues againe, and so as it can bring forth in them no good effect. The seruile feare I obserued before to be in such, who
<pb facs="tcp:150910:252"/> being conuinced in their consciences, do beleeue and know that there is a GOD, but they do not so much loue him as God, as feare him, because he is a iust and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge, that will take vengeance on them for their sinnes. This is that feare which the Apostle speaketh of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 15.</note> where hee speaketh of the faithfull; <hi>Yee haue not</hi> (saith he) <hi>receiued the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to feare again.</hi> The Spirit of bondage is the spirit of them that are bound, as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and Bond-men, who so feare their Masters, that they serue them not for loue or conscience sake, but for feare of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. And of this disposition are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at this day, doing many things which in themselues are good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, profitable and comfortable for those among whom they liue: but not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, nor as fruites of Faith, but for worldly and carnall respects, to get cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and praise among men: and especially to escape by this meanes the seuerity of Gods iudgements. This maketh many (I say) to doe many good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actions, whereas otherwise they would neuer doe them. The other feare is, when as the elect and such as are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:150910:253"/> indeed, do serue &amp; honor God as their father, depend vpō his wil with reuerence, and haue (aboue all thinges) an especiall feare, least by any means they should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, because of the loue which they beare vnto him. They that haue this fear, doe differ as much from the other, who haue the seruile feare, as a chast and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Wife that loueth her Husband, doth differ from a Harlot.

And on the contrary, when they liue in health, in pleasures, in peace, and prosperity, these are no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods speciall loue, but serue onely as snares to holde them fast, and to fat them vp against the day of slaughter. <hi>Their destruction</hi> (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) <hi>shall come suddenly and who knoweth the ruine of them?</hi> Although they be aduanced to the honors and preferments of this life, haue liberty and power to order all thinges at their pleasure, to the benefit of some, and to the hurt of others, as they think good; yet their glory &amp; triumph, their delights and prosperities how great and glorious a shew soeuer they carry to dazel the eies of men, shall not only be of no long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, but euen as nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of their ruine and destruction, which shall be wonderfull fearefull, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for euer. Those things which in their owne Nature are sweete, shall bee sower vnto them; and such thinges which in themselues are bitter, shall become vnto them much more bitter, according as of this difference speaketh the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi> Chapter. 1.<note place="margin">Tit. 1:15.</note>
                  <hi>Vnto the pure are all

                  <hi>To them, which by continuance in well doing, seeke glory, and honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, eternall life: but to them that are contentious, and disobey the truth, and obey vnrighteousnesse, shall bee indignation and wrath, &amp;c.</hi> Now, the due consideration of this truth, as it discouereth and serueth rightly to reprooue the miserable blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and intollerable blockishnesse, and carnall sence of this world, which maketh little or no account at all of the true fear of God, esteemeth and accounteth such alone to bee most blessed and happy, who enioy the riches, honours, and pleasures, of this life: So that if a man bee wealthy, and of countenance and estimation in the World, and passeth his daies in ease and delight, although he be neuer so void of the true feare of God, neuer so vaine and prophane in the whole course of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation; yet is hee thought and iudged of the most part to be an happy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man, hee is much set by, and had in great reuerence and respect: but on the contrary, if a man bee in poore or meane

                  <hi>Blessed is the Man that feareth alway.</hi> Assuring our selues, that hauing the feare of God after this manner before our eies, and walking in obedience according hereunto: how basely soeuer we be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and accounted of in the World, and howsoeuer hated, contemned, or reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet shall we not faile to be blessed of God: For <hi>Blessed is euery man</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) that feareth God.</hi> Hee doth not say that a man is blessed because hee is rich, neither that hee is vnhappy or accursed, because he is either poore, or otherwise contemptible before the Sons▪ of Men: but from hence deriueth he the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all true happinesse, that Men feare God. And therefore for the conclusion at this time, what great neede we haue to pray vnto God, to <hi>Giue vs one heart and one way, that we may feare him for euer.</hi> And to <hi>make an euerlasting couenant with vs, that he will neuer turne away from vs to doe vs good, but to put his feare in our harts,
<pb facs="tcp:150910:262"/> that we may neuer depart from him,</hi> I need not presse it any further, euery man that hath any spirituall feeling, may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and vnderstand it: And the Lorde giue vs all grace to make good vse of it, for Iesus Christs sake, Amen.</p>

            <head>To the godly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lord, the searcher of all heartes (Christian Reader) doth know, that when these Sermons were first preached, there was no purpose at all that they should come (at any time) vnto the Presse. And therefore were the seuerall Doctrines applyed, according to the occasion and necessity of the time, as might best fit the capacity, and tend to the good of those that heard them. Notwithstanding (for the reasons which in the Dedicatory Epistle are expressed) it hath since beene thought most conuenient and necessary, that they should be published. And howsoeuer vpon a second viewe and meditation, many thinges might haue beene added, or changed to the better: yet (for the same reasons and considerations
<pb facs="tcp:150910:264"/> also) it was not iudged either fit or safe. But that all and euery part (as neere as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible without addition or detraction) should come abroade and discouer it selfe (euen at noone day) in matter and forme, in the very same wordes and Phrases, wherein at the first it was deliuered. Nothing doubting but the godly, learned, and iudicious Reader, wil thereupon be induced charitably to interpret all thinges, to beare with such defectes as hee may discerne and iudge the best. Now if that which was intended thus for the good of a fewe (and tended to the offence and hurt of some) doe by this meanes redound to the profit and comfort of many: (for one and the same Doctrine of Christs Gospell becomes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as it is well knowne) a sauour of life to some, and a sauour of death to others:) Let such as feele and find this profit and comfort, praise God for his mercifull prouidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them in this behalfe, and pray for the ioy and comfort of him, who in this hath laboured for the same vnto them. And who in a greater measure (through Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance) shall expresse the desire of his heart heerein hereafter, if God vouchsafe life and peace: and if this already done, haue (as there is hope they will haue) the wished effect.
<pb facs="tcp:150910:264"/> In the meane season, let all true Christians beare this Lesson in minde (as which by woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience) is found most necessary and profitable for them. That they take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heede (as they tender the glory of God and their owne saluation) that they doe not so much respect the persons of such as are set ouer them in the Lorde, as the wholesome Doctrines of Gods word, which they teach and deliuer, least through a dislike which they haue of the men, they lose the grace that is offered vnto them. It being most sure and certaine, not onely by the examples and testimonies of the Scripture, but by lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience, that where the people are ill conceited of the Minister, though he Preach the word of God neuer so soundly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, yet is the profit that they reape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by but very small. Not without great cause therefore, to the end the Iewes might beleeue in him as in the true Sonne of God, sent of God for their good and saluation: doth our Lord Iesus Christ. Iohn <hi>10.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 10, 37, 38.</note> require at their hands a due consideration of his workes. As knowing well, that vntill they had a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him, and by his workes became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he was of God, whatsoeuer hee should teach and Preach, would bee but in
<pb facs="tcp:150910:265"/> vaine, and without effect. And surely this is a point of great importance. Few among many duly considering, what great hurt they doe to themselues, and how much they hinder the saluation of their owne Soules, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their hearts and affections from the Minister, and in nourishing strife and contention with him, whom God hath sent to breake vnto them the Bread of life. If the Minister for his part be not in truth and sincerity of heart, very willing and desirous to liue in loue and peace with those that hear him. If he be guilty in himselfe of bearing enuy or mallice towards any of them, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withall but be guilty of his owne Soule of vnfaithfulnesse in his calling, and that he hath great want of true loue, both towardes Christ and towards his Church. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so long too, it is vnpossible that he should performe the duties of his calling, with such cheerefulnesse, zeale, and power, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he might. And therefore howsoeuer such a one doth worthily deserue to be sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured and reprooued, yet must the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take heede, that (if it be for no other spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall matter in him yet) in regard of their owne good and saluation, they settle their affections vpon him in as kinde and louing a
<pb facs="tcp:150910:265"/> manner as is possible for them. Assuring themselues, that the maine &amp; especiall hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t that can ensue (by quarrelling and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him with, by making him the obiect of their mallice, and by scoffing, reproaching, and traducing him) is to themselues. They hereby hindring their encrease in knowledge, in faith, and repentance; and wilfully debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues of all other graces of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. For so long as they like not the Minister, they come to the hearing of his Preaching with no sincere affections, but with preiudicate opinions, take few admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or reproofes in any good part, are apt to wrest and peruert euery thing they heare. And so whereas the Doctrine taught is in it selfe, and vnto others the sauour of life; it becomes vnto them the sauour of Death. As if it shall please God to open their eyes, and to touch their harts, with griefe of hart, and with remorse of conscience, they will be constrained to acknowledge. Thus wishing to euery faithfull one, as vnto mine owne Soule, I cease any further to hold their eyes from the worke it selfe, which now at length comes to the view, as siluer, no lesse tryed then seauen times in the Fire.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150910:266"/>
            <p>Notwithstanding, of this yet further I must desire the Christian Reader to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that whereas I comprehended the whole ensuing matter of these seauen verses into eight Sermons, and so deliuered it to be printed: it is nowe (but by what meanes I know not) distinguished into twelue. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which new deuision, diuers of them haue neither orderly beginning nor conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The which, as it nothing pleaseth mee to behold: so could I not but cause the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reader (for mine owne discharge) to vnderstand it. It lying not in my power to preuent this change, many of them beeing printed before I had any sufficient notice thereof at all. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
